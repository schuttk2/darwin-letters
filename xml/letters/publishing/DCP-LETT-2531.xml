<p>I have this morning received a message from M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Butler, (who was a Miss Edgeworth)<ref target="#foot.f1"/> that  Madame Belloc Rue Ecole de Medicine (5.) Paris wishes to translate my Book on Species into French.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> She translated some of Miss Edgeworths novels very well, &amp; some of Sismondi’s works.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> She writes in Revue des deux mondes.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> All this sounds very well; my only doubt is whether she is scientific enough. I am, also, excessively puzzled to think how she could have heard of my Book.— I presume that she w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. require to read it before agreeing to translate. I am <hi rend="underline">extremely</hi> anxious for the subject sake (&amp; God knows not for mere fame) to have my Book translated; &amp; indirectly its being known abroad will do good to English Sale.— If it depended on me I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. agree without payment &amp; instantly send copy &amp; only beg that she would get some scientific man to look over the Translation. But I suppose the affair rests in your hands. If you think favourably, will you at once communicate with her (for she begs for immediate answer) &amp; let me hear result. It will save much time if you will write direct. But please apologise for my not writing direct &amp; you may truly say I am much out of health. You might say that though I am a very poor French scholar, I could detect any scientific mistake, &amp; would read over French proofs. Please act as you think fit, remembering how <hi rend="doubleUnderline">earnestly</hi> I wish my views to be known &amp; discussed.</p>
<p>I trust you will excuse this trouble, as I could not possibly write to her, not knowing what power I have.</p>
<p>My dear Sir | Yours very sincerely | C. Darwin</p>
<p>I have heard that you have distributed copies in the country; &amp; I hope to Foreigners &amp; especially the 4 copies to D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Hooker.— Admiral FitzRoy writes that he has not received his copy, so I suppose for some reason you have not distributed the London copies as yet.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I hope you will soon.—</p>
<p>I wish there was any chance of German Translation when you see Sir C. Lyell will you kindly consult him. My Journal was translated: but Translator is dead.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
