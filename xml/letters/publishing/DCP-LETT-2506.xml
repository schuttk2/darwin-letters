<p>I saw yesterday the very last of the proof-sheets. There will soon be clean sheets for Binder and I should be glad to have a copy of my troublesome progeny sent me by Post. Please to let Sir C. Lyell have the remaining clean sheets. But my object in writing is to ask you to inform me as soon as you know, what the trade-price of the volume will be, that I may regulate my presentation copies.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Also I should be very glad to hear what amount (I fear very heavy) I shall have to pay of the excess in charge for corrections as that ought to regulate the number of copies I give away. I should much like to give away 70 beyond the 12 which you very liberally said you would give me. You offered to distribute my presentation copies (I of course paying postage and other expences) and as my health will probably keep me here till middle or end of November, this would be an <hi rend="underline">immense</hi> convenience to me: otherwise I would not have given you this trouble.</p>
<p>But 29 copies I wish to send to almost every part of world to those who have assisted me, viz. Europe, N. America, India, Australia &amp;c. &amp;c. Can you effect this for me? Messrs Williams &amp; Norgate have often sent for me various publications;<ref target="#foot.f4"/> but as I have not entered their shop or ordered a Book for last 18 months (owing to being employed in writing and not reading) I feel some scruple in asking them. Will you kindly answer me on this head and on other points included in this note.</p>
<p>I presume that you would not object to my sending abroad copies, as soon as ever any are ready, and I should be glad of this.</p>
<p>Therefore I should like to fix the number as soon as you can give me the desired information.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I hope to give you no further trouble.</p>
<p>I heartily hope that my Book may be sufficiently successful that you may not repent of having undertaken it and I remain</p>
<p>My dear Sir | Yours sincerely | C. Darwin.</p>
