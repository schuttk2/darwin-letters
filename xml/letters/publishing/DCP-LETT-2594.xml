<p>Asa Gray offers to arrange for reprinting <hi rend="italic">Origin</hi> in U. S. CD has told him JM would send sheets of 2d ed. by post.</p> 
            <p>CD thinks he has good scheme for his "larger work" in three volumes, with separate titles and a general title. Will be two years before first volume is ready because of his health.</p>

<p>I received yesterday a letter from Prof. Asa Gray of U. States, offering to endeavour to make some arrangement for Reprint there of the Origin, with some share of profits, if possible for us.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I have agreed, presuming that you have <hi rend="underline">not</hi> made any arrangement; if you have I can stop it. So please inform me soon. In any case I am very anxious that our second Edition should be reprinted. I have told “Prof. Asa Gray, Cambridge Massachussetts U. States” that you would send him <hi rend="underline">by Post</hi> at once as many clean sheets as are ready (&amp; you can charge copy &amp; postage to me) &amp; remainder as soon as possible.— This would give him an advantage in making bargain for us.—</p>
<p>Please inform me by what channel you sent copy of the Book to him; as he says he has not received it.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>Please, also, inform me whether you have any <hi rend="underline">rule</hi> about number of copies which you give to author of second Edition, as perhaps I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> like a few.</p>
<p>I have returned every sheet to Printers on same day as received.—</p>
<p>I think I have got good scheme for larger work of three separate volumes with separate titles &amp; indices for each but in addition with one general Title.—</p>
<p>My dear Sir | Yours very sincerely | Charles Darwin</p>
<p>With my confounded health I daresay it will be 2 years before the 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> vol. of my larger work will be ready.</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f3">Gray’s copy must have arrived soon after he had written to CD, as he read <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref> in the last week of December 1859 (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2214.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Dupree 1959</ref>, p. 268).
