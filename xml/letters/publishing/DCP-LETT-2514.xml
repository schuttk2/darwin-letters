<p>I have received your kind note &amp; the copy: I am <hi rend="underline">infinitely</hi> pleased &amp; proud at the appearance of my child.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I quite agree to all you propose about price. But you are really too generous about the to me scandalously heavy corrections. Are you not acting unfairly towards yourself? Would it not be better to at least share the <hi rend="superscript">£</hi>72’<hi rend="superscript">s</hi> 80? <ref target="#foot.f3"/> I shall be fully satisfied; for I had no business to send, though quite unintentionally &amp; unexpectedly, such badly composed M.S. to the printers.</p>
<p>Thank you for your kind offer to distribute the copies to my friends &amp; assisters as soon as possible.— Do not trouble yourself much about the foreigners, as M<hi rend="superscript">essrs</hi> Williams &amp; Norgate have most kindly offered to do their best, &amp; they are accustomed to send to all parts of world.</p>
<p>I will pay for my copies, whenever you like.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I am so glad that you were so good as to undertake the publication of my Book.—</p>
<p>My dear Sir | Yours very sincerely | Charles Darwin</p>
<p>P.S. | Please do not forget to let me hear about 2 days before the copies are distributed.</p>
<p>I do not know when I shall leave this place; certainly not for several weeks: Whenever I be in London: I will call on you</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f4">Murray’s accounts indicate that CD was given 12 author’s copies and that 41 were distributed as review copies (Peckham ed. 1959, p. 775).

CD’s Account books (Down House MSS) do not record any payment to Murray during 1859 that might relate to presentation copies. The first entry for a payment of £42 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. made to ‘Murray for copies of Origin’ is dated 12 October 1860. It is not clear whether this was payment for extra copies of the first edition or the second or for both.</note>
