<p>I have to thank you for two notes, one through Hooker, &amp; one with some letters to be posted, which was done.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I anticipated your request by making a few remarks on Owen’s Review.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Hooker is so weary of Reviews; that I do not think you will get any hint from him.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I have lately had many “more kicks than half-pence”. A review in last Dublin Nat. Hist. Review. is the most unfair thing which has appeared,— one mass of misrepresentation. It is evidently by Haughton, the geologist, chemist &amp; mathematician. It shows immeasurable conceit &amp; contempt of all, who are not mathematicians. He discusses Bees-cells, &amp; puts a series, which I have never alluded to, &amp; wholly ignores the intermediate comb of Melipona which alone led me to my notions. The article is a curiosity of unfairness &amp; arrogance. But as he sneers at Malthus, I am content, for it is clear he cannot reason.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>He is a friend of Harvey, with whom I have had some correspondence.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> Your article has clearly as he admits influenced him: he admits to certain extent natural selection, yet I am sure does not understand me. It is strange that very few do, &amp; I am become quite convinced that I must be an extremely bad explainer. To recur for moment to Owen. He grossly misrepresents &amp; is very unfair to Huxley.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> You say that you think the article must be by pupil of Owen; but no one fact tells so strongly against Owen, considering his former position at Coll. of Surgeons, as that he has never reared one pupil or follower.—</p>
<p>In the number just out of Fraser’s magazine, there is article or Review on Lamarck &amp; me by W. Hopkins, the mathematician; who like Haughton despises the reasoning powers of all naturalists. Personally he is extremely kind towards me; but he evidently in following number means to blow me into atoms.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> He does not in least appreciate the difference in my views &amp; Lamarck’s, as explaining adaptation, the principle of divergence, the increase of dominant groups, &amp; the almost necessary extinction of the less dominant &amp; smaller groups &amp;c. &amp;c.—</p>
<p>Talking of adaptation, I have lately been looking at our common orchids, &amp; I daresay the facts are as old &amp; well-known as the hills, but I have been so struck with admiration at the contrivances, that I have sent notice to Gardeners Chronicle.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> The Ophrys Apifera, offers, as you will see, a curious contradiction in structure.— I get on very very slowly with my larger work; &amp; of late from a very unhappy cause, my poor eldest daughter about 16 years old, has now been 40 days ill with low fever: we have had a good deal of anxiety, but I hope &amp; think she has at last turned the corner, though the fever has not gone.—<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>Farewell. When so inclined, pray write;—it is a great pleasure to me to hear from you.—   Yours most truly &amp; gratefully | C. Darwin</p>
<p>P.S. I have been making some little trifling observations which have interested &amp; perplexed me much. I find with Primroses &amp; Cowslips, that about an equal number of plants are thus characterised <hi rend="underline">So called</hi> (by me) <hi rend="underline">male</hi> plants    Pistil much shorter than stamens; stigma rather smooth,—<hi rend="underline">pollen grains large</hi>, throat of corolla short.—</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">So-called female</hi> plants    Pistil much longer than stamens, stigma rougher—<hi rend="underline">pollen-grains smaller</hi>,—throat of corolla long.</p>
<p>I have marked a lot of plants, &amp; expected to find so-called male plants barren; but judging from the feel of the capsules, this is not the case, &amp; I am very much surprised at difference in the size of pollen, which I measured many times &amp; always found 2 to 3/6000 of an inch less in diameter in the “female” than in the “male” plants.— If it should prove that the so-called male plants produce less seed than the so-called females, what a beautiful case of gradation from hermaphrodite to unisexual condition it will be! If they produce about equal number of seed, how perplexing it will be.—<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
