<p>It is a pleasure to me to write to you, as I have no one to talk to about such matters as we write on.—   But I seriously beg you not to write to me, unless so inclined; for busy as you are &amp; seeing many people, the case is very different between us.—</p>
<p>Sir H. Holland came down on Sunday, &amp; consoled us about no immediate cause of anxiety, but feared her recovery would be very slow.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> And on Monday she was so weak &amp; exhausted that we were very unhappy &amp; anxious; but our Bromley Doctor thinks her rather better today.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> It is a miserable long illness.—</p>
<p>I enclose letters (for I had unfortunately written to Harvey before your last letter came, but I begged him <hi rend="underline">not</hi> to answer me) from Harvey &amp; from (received today) A. Gray, for the chance of your liking to see them.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> In the note which you forwarded to me from A. Gray, he begs you &amp; me to give him any hint about Owen’s article in Edinburgh, or other Review.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> You will not be the man to do that. I had already made comments on Owens review, &amp; remarked how basely ungenerous, I thought his treatment of you.—</p>
<p>Have you seen Haughton’s coarsely-abusive article of me in Dublin Mag. of Nat. History.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> It outdoes even N. British &amp; Edinburgh in misapprehension &amp; misrepresentation.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I never knew anything so unfair as in discussing cells of Bees, his ignoring the case of Melipona which builds combs almost exactly intermediate between Hive &amp; Humble-bee.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/> What has Haughton done that he feels so immeasurably superior to all us wretched naturalists &amp; to all political economists, including the great philosopher Malthus?<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>This Review, however, &amp; Harveys letter have convinced me that I must be a very bad explainer. Neither really understand what I mean by natural selection.— I am inclined to give up attempt as hopeless.— Those who do not understand, it seems, cannot be made to understand.—</p>
<p>By the way, I think, we entirely agree, except perhaps that I use too forcible language about selection. I entirely agree, indeed would go almost further than you, when you say that climate (ie variability from all unknown causes) is “an active handmaid influencing its mistress most materially.”— Indeed I have never hinted that Natural selection is “the efficient cause to the exclusion of the other” ie variability from climate &amp;c. The very term <hi rend="underline">selection</hi> implies something, ie variations or differences, to be selected.— You speak of adaptation being rarely <hi rend="underline">visible</hi> though present in plants: I have just recently been looking at common Orchis, &amp; I declare I think its adaptations in every part of flower quite as beautiful &amp; plain, or even more beautiful, than in Woodpecker. I have written &amp; sent notice for Gardeners’ Ch. on curious difficulty in Bee Orchis,<ref target="#foot.f9"/> &amp; sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. much like to hear what you think of the case. In this article I have incidentally touched on adaptation to visits of insects; but the contrivance to keep the sticky glands fresh &amp; sticky beats almost everything in nature. I never remember having seen it described; but it must have been, &amp; as I ought not in my book to give the observation as my own, I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be very glad to know where this beautiful contrivance is described.—<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
<p>A Rev<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dunns wrote N. British R<hi rend="superscript">w</hi>. as I hear from Lyell, who heard from Chambers.—<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
<p>Hopkins of Cambridge has article in Fraser just published;<ref target="#foot.f12"/> he speaks of me in kindest manner personally, but evidently thinks me an illogical &amp; rash blunderer. According to his standard of proof all we naturalists had better shut up shop, &amp; never attempt to reason. He says there is no difference between my view &amp; Lamarcks.—</p>
<p>I am much puzzled about the upshot of the cowslip case; some <hi rend="underline">few</hi> of the capsules on the so-called male plants, judging from external feeling, are swelling as well as on female plants.<ref target="#foot.f13"/> It would be best possible case of transition to have the male plants producing a few, <hi rend="underline">but markedly fewer</hi> seeds than females; but the case w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. require very good evidence. It would be catching a plant in actual transition from hermaphrodite to unisexual condition.— If both so-called males &amp; females plants produce an equal or nearly equal number of seeds, how very strange the specified differences will be, especially that of size of pollen-grains:—<ref target="#foot.f14"/></p>
<p>How does your book progress (I mean your general sort of book on Plants);<ref target="#foot.f15"/> I hope to God you will be more successful than I have been in making people understand your meaning. I should begin to think myself wholly in wrong, &amp; that I was an utter fool, but then I cannot yet persuade myself that Lyell, &amp; you &amp; Huxley, Carpenter, Asa Gray &amp; Watson &amp;c are all fools together. Well time will show, &amp; nothing but time. Farewell.</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f7">A long section in <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2165.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Samuel Haughton’s</ref> anonymous review, headed ‘The causes of variation assigned are not adequate to produce the effects ascribed to them’, criticised CD’s explanation of the formation of bees’ cells ([Haughton] 1860b, pp. 30–1). Haughton referred to the absence of any apparently intermediate stage between the cells of the humble-bee and the hive-bee, ignoring the case of <hi rend="italic">Melipona</hi> discussed by CD in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref>, pp. 225–8. CD marked this section extensively in his copy of [Haughton] 1860b (Darwin Pamphlet Collection–CUL).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f8">Haughton, referring to natural selection, stated: ‘this notable argument is borrowed from Malthus’ doctrine of Population, and will, no doubt, find acceptance with those Political Economists and Pseudo-Philosophers who reduce all the laws of action and human thought habitually to the lowest and most sordid motives.’ ([Haughton] 1860b, p. 27). Haughton refers to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3149.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Thomas Robert Malthus</ref>.</note>

            <note xml:id="foot.f10">CD briefly described his observations of the ‘sticky glands’ of <hi rend="italic">Ophrys</hi> <hi rend="italic">apifera</hi> in his ‘big book’ on species (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5799.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Natural selection</hi></ref>, pp. 67–8). Although this species seemed to offer one of the best examples of continual self-fertilisation, the presence of viscid discs in the flower of the bee orchis indicated to CD that insects might occasionally effect cross-pollination. This point, however, was not developed in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6010.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Orchids</hi></ref>.</note>
