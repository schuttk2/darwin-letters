<p>My dear Lyell.</p>
<p>I was very glad to get your letter.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> We have returned home about a week.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Etty stood the journey well &amp; has decidedly improved a little. One of her most dangerous symptoms has disappeared; but the pulse keeps sadly too high. The Doctors, however, all keep sanguine. They say her face does not look like serious organic mischief.— Hope on is our motto; but of course all this anxiety has much interrupted my work.—</p>
<p>I have laughed at Woodward thinking that you were a man who could be influenced in your judgment by the voice of the public;<ref target="#foot.f3"/> &amp; yet after mentally sneering at him, I was obliged to confess to myself that I had had fears, what the effect might be of so many heavy guns fired by great men.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> As I have (sent by Murray) a spare Quarterly R. I send it by this post; as it may amuse you.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> The anti-jacobin part amused me.— It is full of errors; &amp; Hooker is thinking of answering it.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> There has been a cancelled page; I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> like to know what gigantic blunder it contained. Hooker says that Owen has played on the Bishop &amp; made him strike whatever note he liked; he has wished to make the article as disagreeable to you as possible. I will send the Athenæum in a day or two.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>There has been a second discussion before the American Academy, in which A. Gray argued capitally, but my copy was imperfect so I could not send it to the Athenæum.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>By the way the other day Owen sent me a copy of one of his Reports,<ref target="#foot.f9"/> so he does not wish to come to quarrel with me.</p>
<p>As you wish to hear what Reviews have appeared, I may mention that Agassiz has fired off shot in last Silliman—not good at all—denies variations &amp; rests on perfection of geological evidence.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> Asa Gray tells me that a very clever friend has been almost converted to our side by this Review of Agassiz’s.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> Rudolph Wagner has published in Germany abstract of Agassiz Essay on classification in relations to “Darwins ansichten”, &amp; concludes that the truth lies between us;<ref target="#foot.f12"/> &amp; this will make Agassiz savage. Talking of Germany Huxley tells me the grand news that the truly great Von Baer is much interested with the Origin &amp; goes a long way with us; &amp; that he has spoken publicly &amp; in letter to Huxley says he will perhaps publish on subject.— <ref target="#foot.f13"/></p>
<p>Prof. Parsons has published in same Silliman a speculative paper correcting my notions—worth nothing.—<ref target="#foot.f14"/> In Highland Agricult Journal, there is Review by some entomologist—not worth much.—<ref target="#foot.f15"/> This is all that I can remember; I forget whether I said that there was a third article <hi rend="underline">very good</hi> &amp; geological &amp; favourable in London Review;<ref target="#foot.f16"/> I cannot think who author can be.—   As Huxley says the platoon-firing must soon cease. Hooker &amp; Huxley &amp; Asa Gray, I see, are determined to stick to the battle, &amp; not give in.—   I am fully convinced that whenever you publish, it will produce great effect on all trimmers, &amp; on many others.—   By way I forgot to mention Daubeny’s pamphlet—<hi rend="doubleUnderline">very</hi> liberal &amp; candid; but scientifically weak.—<ref target="#foot.f17"/></p>
<p>I believe Hooker is going nowhere this summer: he is excessively busy. M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. H. is at Worthing, &amp; their Baby has been very delicate &amp; in precarious health. He has written me many most nice letters.— I shall be very curious to hear on your return some news of your Geological doings. Talking of geology, you used to be interested about the “pipes” in the chalk.—<ref target="#foot.f18"/> About 3 years ago a perfectly circular hole suddenly appeared in a flat grass field to everyone’s astonishment &amp; was filled up with many waggon loads of earth; &amp; now 2 or 3 days ago, again it has circularly subsided about two feet more.—   How clearly this shows what is still slowly going on.—</p>
<p>This morning I recommenced work &amp; am at dogs—   when I have written my short discussion on them; I will have it copied &amp; if you like you can then see how the argument stands about their multiple origin. As you seemed to think this important; it might be worth your reading; though I do not feel sure that you will come to same probable conclusion that I have done.—<ref target="#foot.f19"/></p>
<p>By the way, the Bishop makes a very telling case against me by accumulating several instances, where I speak very doubtfully; but this is very unfair, as in such cases, as this of the Dog the evidence is &amp; must be very doubtful.—</p>
<p>Good night with kindest remembrances to Lady Lyell &amp; all your party— | Believe me my dear Lyell | Ever yours most truly | C. Darwin</p>
