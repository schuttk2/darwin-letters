                <div type="transcription">
                     
<p>I will run through your letter.— Parthenogenesis (p. <hi rend="doubleUnderline">9</hi>6) is nothing &amp; I know not why I inserted it in list.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> It is perfectly true that I owe nearly all the corrections to you &amp; several verbal ones to you &amp; others: I am heartily glad you approve of them.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> As yet only two things have annoyed me; those confounded millions of years<ref target="#foot.f3"/> (not that I think it is probably wrong) &amp; my not having by inadvertence mentioned Wallace towards close of Book in summary,—not that anyone has noticed this to me.— I have now put in Wallace’s name at 484 in conspicuous place.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I cannot refer you to tables of mortality of children &amp;c &amp;c. I have notes somewhere, but I have not the <hi rend="doubleUnderline">least</hi> idea where to hunt, &amp; my notes would now be old. I shall be truly glad to read carefully any M.S. on man &amp; give my opinion. You used to caution me to be cautious about man, I suspect I shall have to return the caution a hundred-fold! Yours will no doubt be a grand discussion; but it will horrify the world at first more than my whole volume; although by the sentence (p. 489 new Edit) I show that I believe man is in same predicament with other animals.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> It is in fact impossible to doubt it.— I have thought only vaguely on man. With respect to the Races, one of my best chances of truth has broken down from impossibility of getting facts.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I have one good speculative line, but a man must have entire credence in N. Selection before he will even listen to it.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/> Psychologically I have done scarcely anything. Unless indeed expression of countenance can be included, &amp; on that subject I have collected a good many facts &amp; speculated: but I do not suppose I shall ever publish; but it is an uncommonly curious subject.—<ref target="#foot.f8"/> By the way I sent off a lot of questions the day before yesterday to Tierra del Fuego on expression!<ref target="#foot.f9"/> I <hi rend="underline">suspect </hi>(for I have never read it) that “Spencer’s Psychology” has a bearing on Psychology, as <hi rend="underline">we</hi> should look at it.—<ref target="#foot.f10"/> By all means read Preface in about 20 pages, of Hensleigh Wedgwoods new Dictionary on <hi rend="doubleUnderline">first</hi> origin of Language:<ref target="#foot.f11"/> Erasmus could lend it.<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
<p>I agree about Carpenter,—a very good article, but with not much original.<ref target="#foot.f13"/></p>
<p>I am very sorry that Lindley did not write in Gardeners’ Chronicle.—<ref target="#foot.f14"/></p>
<p>Andrew Murray (the Entomologist &amp; dabbler in Botany) has criticised in Address to Botanical Soc. of Edinburgh the notice in Linn. Journal,<ref target="#foot.f15"/> &amp; “has disposed of” the whole theory by an ingenious difficulty, which I was very stupid not to have thought of; for I express surprise at more &amp; analogous cases not being known. The difficulty is that amongst the blind insects of the caves in distant parts of world, there are some of the same genus, &amp; yet the genus is not found out of caves, or living in the free world.<ref target="#foot.f16"/> I have little doubt that like the fish Amblyopsis &amp; like Proteus <hi rend="underline">in Europe</hi>, these insects are “wrecks of ancient life” or “living fossils”, saved from competition &amp; extermination.<ref target="#foot.f17"/> But that formerly seeing insects of the same genus roamed over the whole area in which the caves are included.</p>
<p>Farewell | Yours affect<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> | C. Darwin</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Our</hi> ancestor was an animal which breathed water, had a swim-bladder, a great swimming tail, an imperfect skull &amp; undoubtedly was an hermaphrodite! Here is a pleasant genealogy for mankind.—<ref target="#foot.f18"/></p>
