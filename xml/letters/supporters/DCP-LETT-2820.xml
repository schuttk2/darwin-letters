<p>Poor Etty’s fever drags on its weary course &amp; Sunday will be five weeks.— I believe there is no cause yet for serious anxiety, but we have sent for Sir H. Holland<ref target="#foot.f1"/> to aid our local Doctor.—</p>
<p>I sent yesterday A. Murray’s review:<ref target="#foot.f2"/> the speculative parts seem to me weak. I am not convinced that I have misrepresented Schiödte.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Have you seen Hopkins in the new Fraser?<ref target="#foot.f4"/> the public will I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> think, find it heavy. He will be dead against me as you prophesied; but he is generously civil to me personally. On his standard of proof, <hi rend="underline">natural</hi> science would never progress; for without the making of theories, I am convinced there would be no observation.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I have ordered the Future,<ref target="#foot.f6"/> &amp; have begun reading the N. British,<ref target="#foot.f7"/> which so far strikes me as clever.</p>
<p>Phillips’ Lecture at Cambridge is to be published.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>All these reiterated attacks will tell heavily; there will be no more converts &amp; probably some will go back. I hope you do not grow disheartened. I am determined to fight to the last.—   I hear, however, that the <hi rend="underline">great</hi> Buckle highly approves of my Book.—<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>I have had note from poor Blyth of Calcutta, who is much disappointed at hearing that L. Canning will not grant any money;<ref target="#foot.f10"/> so I much fear that all your great pains will be thrown away.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> Blyth says (&amp; he in many respect a very good judge) that his ideas on Species are quite revolutionised.</p>
<p>I send Asa Gray’s letter,<ref target="#foot.f12"/> though it is really not worth sending; &amp; do not return it till you have occasion to write; though if I were not the most honourable of men, I should jump at the excuse of getting a note from you &amp; require his letter back soon.—</p>
<p>I have never attended to gestation of dog question,<ref target="#foot.f13"/> thinking it’s importance overrated, as the period is known to be variable in many of our domestic animals.— But I have begun to make some enquiries, &amp; have got <hi rend="underline">accurate</hi> return from excellent stud of Grey-hounds—period varies from 60— or 61 (according as 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> day reckoned)—to 65 or 66 days.</p>
<p>I do not think lowness of Rodents has any bearing on the question of fertility of Hybrids, as plants, &amp; even Fuci, follow same general laws in these respects with animals.—</p>

CD had consulted him on previous occasions when health problems in the family were particularly severe (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 4). The Darwins’ local doctor had diagnosed her illness as a form of typhus fever (<ref target="./DCP-LETT-2795.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to J. D. Hooker, 11 May [1860]</ref>).</note>

CD had apparently just received a printed copy of the review. Murray criticised CD’s discussion of the improbability of the separate creation of blind insects in caves located on separate continents (Murray 1860a, p. 286): <quote type="quote"> It is quite correct for him [CD] to say that we should expect close similarity in the caves in question, but it is incorrect to say that “this is not the case”; for the similarity in some is marvellously close; and it is also incorrect to say that Schiödte and others have remarked that “this is not the case.” </quote> The reference is to Schiödte 1849.</note>

A copy of the review is in the Darwin Pamphlet Collection–CUL. A second article discussing <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref> appeared in the May issue; a copy of this piece is also in the Pamphlet Collection.

The source of information concerning Buckle’s remark has not been traced, but Buckle wrote favourably about <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref> in his correspondence. In 1859 he told a friend that the book was ‘full of thought, and of original matter’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_3973.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Huth 1880</ref>, 2: 28).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f10"><ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_498.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Edward Blyth’s</ref> name had been put forward by CD for the post of naturalist to the forthcoming expedition to China (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 7, letters to W. H. Sykes, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-2588.xml" resp="#automat">20 December [1859]</ref>, and to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3051.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Charles Lyell</ref>, 29 [December 1859]). <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_818.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Charles John Canning</ref> had been made viceroy of India in 1858 after the East India Company transferred power to the British Crown. He objected to the appointment of a naturalist to the China expedition on the ground that scientific observations in a hostile country would entail personal danger. Despite Blyth’s assurances that he was ‘quite willing to encounter the danger’, no naturalist was appointed (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_3158.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Grote 1875</ref>).</note>
