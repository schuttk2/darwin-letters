<p>Thanks JDH for his report on the reading of the Wallace and Darwin papers at the Linnean Society [read 1 July 1858; <hi rend="italic">Collected papers</hi> 2: 3–19]. Considers how to publish his work. Offers to forward a note from JDH to Wallace.</p>

<p>We are become more happy &amp; less panic-struck, now that we have sent out of House every child &amp; shall remove Etty, as soon as she can move. The first nurse became ill with ulcerated throat &amp; quincy &amp; the second is now ill with the Scarlet Fever, but thank God recovering. You may imagine how frightened we have been. It has been a most miserable fortnight.—</p>
<p>Thank you much for your note, telling me that all had gone on prosperously at Linn. Soc<hi rend="superscript">y</hi>.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> You must let me once again tell you how deeply I feel your generous kindness &amp; Lyell’s on this occasion. But in truth it shames me that you should have lost time on a mere point of priority.</p>
<p>I shall be curious to see proofs. I do not in the least understand whether my letter to A. Gray is to be printed; I suppose not, only your note; but I am quite indifferent, &amp; place myself absolutely in your &amp; Lyells hands.</p>
<p>I can easily prepare an abstract of my whole work, but I can hardly see how it can be made scientific for a Journal, without giving facts, which would be impossible. Indeed a mere abstract cannot be very short.— Could you give me any idea how many pages of Journal, could probably be spared me?<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>Directly after my return home, I would begin &amp; cut my cloth to my measure.— If the Referees were to reject it as not strictly scientific I would, perhaps publish it as pamphet.—</p>
<p>With respect to my big interleaved abstract, would you send it anytime before you leave England, to enclosed address.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> If you do not go till August 7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>–10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. prefer it left with you.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I hope you have jotted criticisms on my M.S. on big Genera &amp;c sufficient to make you remember your remarks, as I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be infinitely sorry to lose them.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> And I see no chance of our meeting if you go soon abroad.</p>
<p>We thank you heartily for your invitation to join you; I can fancy nothing which I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. enjoy more; but our children are too delicate for us to leave; &amp; I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be mere living lumber.—</p>
<p>Lastly you said you would write to Wallace; I certainly sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. much like this, as it would quite exonerate me: if you would send me your note, sealed up, I would forward it with my own, as I know address &amp;c.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>Will you answer me sometime about your notions of length of my abstract.—</p>
<p>If you see Lyell will you tell him how truly grateful I feel for his kind interest in this affair of mine. You must know that I look at it, as very important, for the reception of the view of species not being immutable, the fact of the greatest geologist &amp; Botanist in England, taking <hi rend="underline">any sort of interest</hi> in subject: I am sure it will do much to break down prejudices.—</p>
<p>Yours affectionly | C. Darwin</p>

When <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1222.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Francis Darwin</ref> later came to compile CD’s letters for publication, Hooker sent him his recollections of the meeting at which Darwin and Wallace 1858 was read. He wrote (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4842.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">LL</hi></ref> 2: 126): <quote> The interest excited was intense, but the subject was too novel and too ominous for the old school to enter the lists, before armouring. After the meeting it was talked over with bated breath: Lyell’s approval, and perhaps in a small way mine, as his lieutenant in the affair, rather overawed the Fellows, who would otherwise have flown out against the doctrine. We had, too, the vantage ground of being familiar with the authors and their theme.</quote></note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">CD planned to write an abstract of his researches to be published in the <hi rend="italic">Journal of the Proceedings of the Linnean</hi> <hi rend="italic">Society</hi>. This would give a more thorough account of his theory than the brief notice read to the <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2944.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Linnean Society</ref> (Darwin and Wallace 1858). Hooker was actively involved with resuscitating and rationalising the various publications of the <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2944.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Linnean Society</ref> (see L. Huxley ed. 1918,1: 407–10).</note>
