<p>I have directed a copy of my Book (as yet only an abstract) on the Origin of species to be sent you.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I know how you are pressed for time; but if you can read it, I shall be infinitely gratified. From its condensed state it is <hi rend="underline">indispensable</hi> to read it <hi rend="underline">all</hi> straight through. If ever you do read it, &amp; can screw out time to send me (as I value your opinion so highly) however short a note, telling me what you think its weakest &amp; best parts, I should be extremely grateful. As you are not a geologist you will excuse my conceit in telling you that Lyell highly approves of the two geological chapters; &amp; thinks that on the Imperfection of the Geological Record not exaggerated.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> He is nearly a convert to my views.—</p>
<p>I have been so hard worked &amp; my health so bad that I have not yet read your Japan Flora;<ref target="#foot.f3"/> but I will hereafter borrow Hooker’s copy. Hooker sent me a few pages in which you propound a doctrine of migration into America like that, which I sent you last summer in a letter.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Dana is of course a far better authority than I am; but his arguments have by no means convinced me in regard to the warm period <hi rend="underline">subsequent</hi> to the Glacial period.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I daresay I may be wrong, but I rather doubt whether his &amp; your view will explain facts of distribution so well as my view of migration during the certainly warmer period anteriorly to the Glacial period.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> Anyhow on my heteredox doctrine of modification your view does not bear on the representative species in the middle U. States. I thought of your doctrine several years ago, &amp; consulted Lyell, but rejected it as less safe than the warm period anteriorly to Glacial Period. There seemed to me some little confusion about your fossil Elephants: the species in N. &amp; S. States, I believe, are distinct according to Falconer.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> The northern one, anyhow, can hardly be adduced as evidence of warmer climate. But it is foolish in me to write on; for I am writing only after one hasty read, several months ago.—</p>
<p>Your Japan work must have been extremely interesting.</p>
<p>Farewell, with every good wish, especially for a little spare time for you</p>
<p>Pray believe me | Dear Gray | Yours very sincerely | Charles Darwin</p>
<p>P.S. I suppose that you have not succeeded in getting me any information on correlation of complexion in Europeans &amp; tendency to yellow or other Tropical Fevers.—<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>Let me add that I fully admit that there are very many difficulties not satisfactorily explained by my theory of descent with modification, but I cannot possibly believe that a false theory would explain so many classes of facts, as I think it certainly does explain.— On these grounds I drop my anchor &amp; believe that the difficulties will slowly disappear.—</p>
