<p>I have thought that you might like to add the enclosed very pretty arrow-heads to your Collection. They were sent me by M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Moir,—the mother-in-law of Col. Erskine.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> The place is given in note within; &amp; they may be considered authentic &amp; will make good contrast with the Cets.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>You need not believe one word of what I said about gestation of dogs;<ref target="#foot.f3"/> since writing to you I have had more correspondence with the master of Hounds, &amp; I see his record is worth nothing—   it may of course be correct, but cannot be trusted.— I find also different statements about wolf—in fact I am all abroad.—</p>
<p>I have given up Oxford;<ref target="#foot.f4"/> for my stomach has utterly broken down &amp; I am forced to go on Thursday for a little water-cure, to “D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lanes Sudbrook Park, Richmond Surrey”,<ref target="#foot.f5"/> where I shall stay a week, &amp; sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. stay rather longer had it not been for Etty. Etty improves slightly, but so slightly that it takes weeks to perceive any difference; she cannot sit up in bed for more than few minutes.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/> Farewell—   I hope that you will have pleasant time at Oxford; I much wished to have been there, but I could not stand it, or indeed anything.— Ever yours | C. Darwin</p>
<p>P.S. Many thanks for letter just received.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I return Dawson, which I was glad to see.—<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I must borrow his Review sometime, for my Bookseller has never had copy.—<ref target="#foot.f9"/> I do not think much of Dawson’s letter. It would be insanity to compare evidence of organic change with geological change, at present, as far as strength of evidence goes.</p>
<p>But what inches of elevation on coast of Sweden are to great mountains so are the numerous varieties &amp; endless doubt what to call species &amp; what varieties, to undoubted species.—   I entirely deny that there is no evidence of change. But time alone will bring naturalists round, when they find that they can explain many facts on such views as mine, &amp; cannot on view of creation.—</p>
<p>Farewell.—</p>
