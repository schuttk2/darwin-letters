<p>I am sorry that I was out when you called yesterday,—a rare event for me.— I think your abstract <hi rend="underline">quite excellent</hi> &amp; perfectly clear.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Many of your remarks strike me as very curious.— In one case I doubted for a minute whether your remark was <hi rend="underline">general</hi> or applied to last-named insect, &amp; I have marked place with pencil &amp; I think in 2 or 3 other places, the same doubt might occur, so I think you had better read it over, remembering that ignorant readers will blunder if possible.— For ignoramus, like myself I wish you would in parentheses make clear what is macula germativa as distinct from germinal vesicle.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Are you sure that Aphides do occur in Tropics; incidentally from Lund, it appears that they do <hi rend="underline">not</hi> occur in tropical Brazil.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I congratulate you heartily on producing so profound &amp; philosophical a memoir.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>Yours most truly | C. Darwin</p>
<p>P.S. Will you tell Sir John that I did not answer his note about my wells, because I received a message that Parslow’s answers had sufficed.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I remember reading several years ago a good paper, I think in Geological Journal, (author’s name forgotten) on level of water in Chalk N. of London, &amp; the Author showed that the line of height of water at different points formed a rather steep slope—that it might be compared to a river slowly oozing or flowing through the chalk; &amp; he showed that wet weather did not affect the level at any one point, till, I think, nearly six months after-wards.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>C. Darwin</p>
<p>The author was connected with Paper-mills &amp; had made many very careful observations.</p>
<p>I quite forgot to thank you about Sir C. Nicholson’s letter on Bees: it will not do to quote, which I am very sorry for.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I had thougt of Partridges.—<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">Dated by CD’s reference to an abstract written by Lubbock. Lubbock read the paper (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4916.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Lubbock 1859</ref>) at a meeting of the Royal Society on 9 December 1858, but it was received on 10 November. The abstract was presumably composed at approximately the same time.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">CD refers to a manuscript version of Lubbock’s abstract of his paper. The abstract was printed in <hi rend="italic">Proceedings of the Royal Society of London</hi> 9 (1857–9): 574–83.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">In the printed abstract, Lubbock stated that the macula germinativa ‘is in fact the nucleus of the germinal vesicle’. The change indicates that the abstract was revised following CD’s suggestion (<hi rend="italic">Proceedings of the Royal Society of London</hi> 9 (1857–9): 577).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4"><ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4969.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Lund 1831</ref>. A note on this work in DAR 205.11: 54 includes this information. Lubbock had suggested that in cold or mountainous regions, aphids would always be oviparous, while in tropical regions they would be naturally viviparous throughout the year (<hi rend="italic">Proceedings of the Royal Society of London</hi> 9 (1857–9): 583). CD’s comment was not incorporated into the abstract.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">Lubbock introduced his full paper, published in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London</hi> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4916.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Lubbock 1859</ref>), with a historical account of the recent research on asexual generation in nature. Since many of the known cases were from insects, he intended to review the process of egg-cell formation in the Insecta. Lubbock had been elected FRS in June 1858 on the basis of his earlier work (Lubbock 1857b) on this problem (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 6, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-2149.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to John Lubbock, [22 November 1857]</ref>).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f6">CD and John William Lubbock discussed the height of the water in their wells on several occasions (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-1846.xml" resp="#automat">letter to J. W. Lubbock, 2 April [1859]</ref>). <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3699.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Joseph Parslow</ref> was the Darwins’ butler.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f7">The paper has not been identified, but the topics mentioned by CD were discussed in detail in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6407.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Prestwich 1851</ref>.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f8">Probably <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3522.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Charles Nicholson</ref>, speaker of the legislative council of New South Wales, who had been knighted in 1852. CD was preparing a paper that discussed the relationship between introduced plants, such as clover, and native species of bees, taking New Zealand as an example. See letter to <hi rend="italic">Gardeners’</hi> <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi>, [before 13 November 1858].</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f9">CD thought that seeds might be carried long distances in the dirt adhering to the feet of partridges. See letters to W. E. Darwin, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-2328.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">22 [September 1858]</ref>, and to T. C. Eyton, 11 October [1858].</note>
