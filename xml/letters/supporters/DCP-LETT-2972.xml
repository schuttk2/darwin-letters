<p>My dear Huxley</p>
<p>Your note has been wonderfully interesting. Your term “pithecoid man” is a whole paper &amp; theory in itself.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> How I hope the skull of the new Macrauchenia has come:<ref target="#foot.f3"/> it is grand.—</p>
<p>I return Hooker’s letter, with very many thanks. The glacial action on Lebanon is particularly interesting considering its position between Europe &amp; Himalaya:<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I get more &amp; more convinced that my doctrine of <hi rend="underline">mundane</hi> glacial period is correct, &amp; that it is the most important of all late phenomena with respect to distribution of plants &amp; animals.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>I hope your Review progresses favourably.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>I am exhausted &amp; not well so write briefly; for we have had 9 days of as much misery as man can endure.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> My poor daughter has suffered pitiably, &amp; night &amp; day required three persons to support her. The crisis of extreme danger is over &amp; she is rallying surprisingly, but the Doctors are yet doubtful of ultimate issue. But the suffering was so pitiable I almost got to wish to see her die. She is easy now. When she will be fit to travel home we know not.—</p>
<p>I most sincerely hope that M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Huxley keeps up pretty well.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> The work which most men have to do is a blessing to them in such cases as yours.—</p>
<p>God Bless you | C. Darwin</p>
<p>Sir H. Holland came here to see her &amp; was wonderfully kind.—<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f2">Pithecoid: ‘resembling in form or pertaining to the apes, esp. the higher or anthropoid apes’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5936.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">OED</hi></ref>). Huxley was apparently writing his essay on the zoological relations of man with the lower animals (T. H. Huxley 1861b), at the beginning of which he touched on the implications of demonstrating that humankind had a ‘pithecoid pedigree’ (T. H. Huxley 1861b, p. 67). Huxley’s essay attacked <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3629.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Richard Owen’s</ref> view that there were great anatomical differences between the higher apes and human beings. Huxley concluded that ‘the Quadrumana differ less from man than they do from one another; and that, hence, the separation of <hi rend="italic">Homo</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pithecus</hi> in distinct sub-classes, while <hi rend="italic">Pithecus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cynocephalus</hi> are retained in one order, is utterly inconsistent with the principle of any classification of the Mammalia by cerebral characters.’ (T. H. Huxley 1861b, p. 84).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">Huxley read a paper at a meeting of the Geological Society on 21 November 1860 on some vertebrate remains discovered in Bolivia by <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1678.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">David Forbes</ref> (T. H. Huxley 1861a). Huxley described a new species of <hi rend="italic">Macrauchenia</hi> that was distinct from that described by Owen in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2623.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Fossil Mammalia</hi></ref>, pp. 35–56, on the basis of bones collected by CD during the <hi rend="italic">Beagle</hi> voyage (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 2). The remains found by Forbes included a portion of the skull and fragments of teeth; no part of <hi rend="italic">Macrauchenia</hi> skull had previously been discovered. Owen had found the <hi rend="italic">Beagle</hi> specimens to have a combination of perissodactyl and artiodactyl characters, but assigned the genus to the perissodactyl Pachydermata. Huxley found characteristics of both divisions in Forbes’s skull and tooth specimens and remarked that <hi rend="italic">Macrauchenia</hi> had ‘strong claims to be considered an example of what has been termed “a generalized type’” (T. H. Huxley 1861a, p. 84). For a discussion of the history of the classification of <hi rend="italic">Macrauchenia</hi>, see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6496.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Rachootin 1985</ref>.</note>

Lyell ed. 1881, 2: 329): <quote type="quote"> Did I tell you of Hooker’s ascent of Lebanon, 11,000 feet high, and his finding, though now there is no perpetual snow there, old glacier moraines descending 4,000 feet down from the summit, of which he has made some very graphic sketches? All the cedars of Lebanon grow exclusively on these moraines. </quote></note>
