                </opener>
                <div type="transcription">
                     
<p>Thank you much for your note of the 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. <ref target="#foot.f2"/> I am very glad to hear that you are at Torquay. I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. have amused myself earlier by writing to you; but I have had Hooker &amp; Huxley staying here, &amp; they have fully occupied my time;<ref target="#foot.f3"/> as a little of anything is a full dose for me.— I have got “The Future”, but cannot clearly make head or tail of it.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> There has been a plethora of Reviews, &amp; I am really quite sick of myself.— There is very long Review by Carpenter in Med.-Chirurg. Review:<ref target="#foot.f5"/> <hi rend="underline">very good</hi> &amp; well-balanced but not brilliant. He discusses Hookers book at as great length as mine, &amp; makes <hi rend="underline">excellent</hi> extracts; but I could not get Hooker to feel the least interest in being praised.</p>
<p>Carpenter speaks of you in thoroughily proper terms.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> There is a <hi rend="underline">brilliant</hi> review by Huxley, with capital hits;<ref target="#foot.f7"/> but I do not know that he much advances subject: I <hi rend="underline">think</hi> I have convinced him that he has hardly allowed weight enough to the cases of varieties of plants being in some degree sterile.—<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>To diverge from Reviews Asa Gray sends me from Wyman (who will write) a good case of all the pigs being black in the Everglades of Virginia;<ref target="#foot.f9"/> on asking about cause, it seems (I have got capital analogous cases) that when the <hi rend="underline">black</hi> pigs eat a certain nut, their bones become red &amp; they suffer to certain extent, but that the <hi rend="underline">white</hi> pigs lose their hoofs &amp; perish; “&amp; we aid by <hi rend="underline">selection</hi> for we kill most of the young white pigs”    This was said by man who could hardly read.—</p>
<p>By the way it is a great blow to me that you cannot admit to potency of natural selection; the more I think of it, the less I doubt its power for great &amp; small changes.—</p>
<p>I have just read the Edinburgh, which without doubt is by Owen.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> It is extremely malignant, clever &amp; I fear will be very damaging. He is atrociously severe on Huxley’s lecture, &amp; very bitter against Hooker. So we three <hi rend="underline">enjoyed</hi> it together: not that I really enjoyed it, for it made me uncomfortable for one night; but I have got quite over it today. It requires much study to appreciate all the bitter spite of many of the remarks against me; indeed I did not discover all myself.— It scandalously misrepresents many parts. He misquotes some passages altering words within inverted commas. Makes me say that the dorsal vertebræ of pigeons vary &amp; refers to page where the word dorsal does not appear. Sneers at my saying a certain organ is the branchiæ of Balanidæ; whilst in his own “Invertebrata” published before I published on cirripedes, he calls them organs without doubt branchiæ.—<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
<p>It is painful to be hated in the intense degree with which Owen hates me.—</p>
<p>Now for a curious thing about my Book, &amp; then I have done. In last Saturday Gardeners’ Chronicle, a M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Patrick Matthews publishes long extract from his work on “Naval Timber &amp; Arboriculture” published in 1831, in which he briefly but completely anticipates the theory of Nat. Selection.—<ref target="#foot.f12"/> I have ordered the Book, as some few passages are rather obscure but it, is certainly, I think, a complete but not developed anticipation!<ref target="#foot.f13"/> Erasmus always said that surely this would be shown to be the case someday. Anyhow one may be excused in not having discovered the fact in a work on “Naval Timber”.</p>
<p>I heartily hope that your Torquay work may be successful.<ref target="#foot.f14"/> Give my kindest remembrances to Falconer, &amp; I hope he is pretty well.— Hooker &amp; Huxley (with M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Huxley) were extremely pleasant, but poor dear Hooker is tired to death of my Book; &amp; it is a marvel &amp; prodigy if you are not worse tired, if that be possible.</p>
<p>Farewell my dear Lyell | Yours affect | C. Darwin</p>
<p>How hard it is to please everyone. I told Jukes that I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. leave out in any next Edition about the Weald, &amp; he demurred greatly &amp; said “he almost fancied he had written himself”, as he bravely told Murchison.—<ref target="#foot.f15"/></p>
