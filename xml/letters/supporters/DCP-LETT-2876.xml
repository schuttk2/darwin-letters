<p>Owing to absence from home at Water-cure &amp; then having to move my sick girl to whence I am now writing,<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I have only lately read the discussion in Proc.<hi rend="superscript">s</hi> American Acad.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> And I now I cannot resist expressing my sincere admiration of your most clear powers of reasoning. As Hooker lately said in a note to me, you are more than <hi rend="underline">anyone</hi> else the thorough master of the subject.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I declare that you know my Book as well as I do myself; &amp; bring to the question new lines of illustration &amp; argument, in a manner which excites my astonishment &amp; almost my <hi rend="underline">envy</hi>! I admire these discussions, I think, almost more than your article in Silliman’s Journal.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> Every single word seems weighed carefully, &amp; tells like a 32-pound shot. It makes me much wish (but I know that you have not time) that you could write more in detail; &amp; give, <hi rend="underline">for instance</hi>, the facts on the variability of the American wild fruits.—</p>
<p>The Athenæum has largest circulation &amp; I have sent my copy to Editor with request that he would republish the first discussion: I much fear he will not, as he reviewed subject in so hostile a spirit &amp; is not a liberal man.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I fear that I shall lose my copy.—   I have received p. 410 to 416—and pp. 425 to 434—, so that pages 417 to 424 are missing<ref target="#foot.f7"/>    I wish you would tell me whether I could buy these sheets of Proceedings.—</p>
<p>New York Times had not arrived when I left home.—   Hooker has lent me (<hi rend="underline">&amp; was much puzzled about authorship</hi>!) the July Monthly Atlantic:<ref target="#foot.f8"/> it is uncommonly pleasantly written, &amp; will tell well on public.—   I shall be curious (&amp; will order) the August number, as soon as I know that it contains your Review of Reviews.—<ref target="#foot.f9"/> My conclusion is that you have made a mistake in being a Botanist, you ought to have been a Lawyer, &amp; you would have rolled in wealth by perverting the truth, instead of studying the living truths of this world.—</p>
<p>Of Reviews I have to report one in Quarterly by the Bishop of Oxford (Wilberforce) aided by Owen:<ref target="#foot.f10"/> it is uncommonly clever, not worth anything scientifically, but quizzes me in splendid style till I chuckled with laughter at myself—   From all that I gather, the B. Assoc. at Oxford advanced subject greatly, owing to effort of Hooker, Huxley &amp; Lubbock, not withstanding incessant attacks. Henslow &amp; Daubeny are shaken.—<ref target="#foot.f11"/> I hear from Hooker that he hears from Hochstetter that my views are making very considerable progress in Germany;<ref target="#foot.f12"/> &amp; that good workers are discussing the question. Bronn at end of his Translation has a chapter of Criticism; but it is such difficult German, that I have not yet read it.—<ref target="#foot.f13"/> Hopkins’ Review in Fraser is thought the best which has appeared against us;<ref target="#foot.f14"/> I believe that Hopkins is so much opposed because his course of study has never led him to reflect much on such subjects as Geograph. Distribution, Classification, Homologies &amp;c &amp;c; so that he does not feel it a relief to have some kind of explanation.—</p>
<p>I see most clearly that my Book would have been a dead failure, had it not been for all the generous labour bestowed on it (not for my sake, but for subject sake) by yourself, Hooker, Huxley &amp; Carpenter; &amp; to these names I hope soon Lyell’s may be added.—   But I know that the Quarterly will cause Lyell to shake in his shoes.<ref target="#foot.f15"/> Considering his age, his former views &amp; position in Society, I think his conduct has been heroic on this subject.—</p>
<p>I am tired, so will write no more. Farewell my kind &amp; good friend. | Yours most truly | C. Darwin</p>
