<p>I forget whether you take in Times: for the chance of not doing so I send the enclosed rich letter.— It is, I am sure, by FitzRoy;<ref target="#foot.f2"/> for he wrote to me the other day on population of world not having increased,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> &amp; in his Voyages there is the pebble theory.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> It is a pity he did not add his theory of the extinction of Mastodon &amp;c from the door of ark being made too small.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> What a mixture of conceit &amp; folly, &amp; the greatest newspaper in the world, inserts it!</p>
<p>Ever yours | C. Darwin</p>
<p>I have had letter from Carpenter this morning: he reviews me in National.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> He is convert, but does not go quite as far as I—but quite far enough; for he admits that all Birds from one progenitor; &amp; probably all fishes &amp; reptiles from another parent. But the last mouthful chokes him—he can hardly admit all Vertebrates from one parent.— He will surely come to this from Homology &amp; Embryology.—</p>
<p>I look at it as grand having brough round a great physiologist, for great I think he certainly is in that line.—</p>
<p>How curious I shall be to know what line Owen will take,—dead against us I fear; but he wrote me a <hi rend="underline">most</hi> liberal note on the reception of my Book, &amp; said he was quite prepared to consider fairly &amp; without prejudice any line of argument.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">The Saturday following the notice in <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi> mentioned in the letter (see n. 2, below).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2"><hi rend="italic">The Times</hi>, 1 December 1859, p. 8, carried a letter signed ‘Senex’ that commented on the consequence of revising the antiquity of man in the light of the recently discovered flint implements being discussed in scientific circles. CD’s name was linked with that of <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2392.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Leonard Horner</ref> in supposing that mankind had existed for 14,000 years, a point that had been made in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_3867.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Horner 1858</ref> (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-2244.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to the Secretary, Royal Society, 22 March 1858</ref>). CD’s identification of the author as <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1650.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Robert FitzRoy</ref> was correct (see n. 3, below, and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5367.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Mellersh 1968</ref>, pp. 271–2).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">FitzRoy’s letter to CD has not been found, but he recounted its contents in a letter to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1337.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">William Hepworth Dixon</ref>, the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Athenæum</hi>, on 29 November 1859, a copy of which is in DAR 221. FitzRoy told Dixon about his letter to the <hi rend="italic">The</hi> <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> (see n. 2, above). He also stated that he agreed with the critical review of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref> published in <hi rend="italic">Athenæum</hi>, 19 November 1859, pp. 659–60. He went on to say (DAR 221): <quote> Remarkably—I had just glanced at his book, the day <hi rend="italic">before</hi> that Athenæum appeared—and <hi rend="italic">at once</hi> wrote to express my alarm at his extreme views.— I noticed a few salient points, (<hi rend="italic">also</hi> remarked in the Critique) and ended by saying— “My dear old friend—<hi rend="italic">I</hi>, at least, <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> find anything ”ennobling“ in the thought of being a descendant of even the <hi rend="italic">most</hi> ancient <hi rend="italic">Ape</hi>”. He has <hi rend="italic">not</hi> replied. I presume that Darwin’s whole time for some years has been so much engrossed by his own avocations—his pigeon and rabbit breeding and his microscopic investigations—that he has scarcely used a <hi rend="italic">telescope</hi>—for a wide range, and comprehensive view—has hardly read the works of later Authorities—<hi rend="italic">except</hi> those <hi rend="italic">bits</hi> of them which he could use in his own work. This <hi rend="italic">used</hi> to be his habit—and the consequence was partial instead of fair results.</quote></note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4"><ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5784.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Narrative</hi></ref> 2: 667. FitzRoy maintained that rounded pebbles did not necessarily indicate previous water action; the stones might have gained their shape through volcanic activity.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">FitzRoy had written in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5784.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Narrative</hi></ref> 2: 671: ‘As the creatures approached the ark, might it not have been easy to admit some, perhaps the young and the small, while the old and large were excluded?’</note>
