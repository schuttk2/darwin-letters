        <abstract> 
<p>A copy of CD’s book [<hi rend="italic">Origin</hi>] has been sent to ARW; invites his comments. "God knows what the public will think". Hooker believes Lyell is a convert, but CD does not think so, although he is "deeply interested". If he can convert Huxley, CD will be content.</p>

<p>I have told Murray to send you by Post (if possible) a copy of my Book &amp; I hope that you will receive it at nearly same time with this note.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> (N.B I have got a bad finger which makes me write extra badly—) If you are so inclined, I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. very much like to hear your general impression of the Book as you have thought so profoundly on subject &amp; in so nearly same channel with myself. I hope there will be some little new to you, but I fear not much. Remember it is only an abstract &amp; very much condensed. God knows what the public will think. No one has read it, except Lyell, with whom I have had much correspondence. Hooker thinks him a complete convert; but he does not seem so in his letters to me; but he is evidently deeply interested in subject.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I do not think your share in the theory will be overlooked by the real judges as Hooker Lyell, Asa Gray &amp;c.—</p>
<p>I have heard from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sclater that your paper on Malay Arch. has been read at Linn. Soc, &amp; that he was <hi rend="underline">extremely</hi> much interested by it.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I have not seen one naturalist for 6 or 9 months owing to the state of my health, &amp; therefore I really have no news to tell you.— I am writing this at Ilkley Wells, where I have been with my family for the last six weeks &amp; shall stay for some few weeks longer. As yet I have profited very little. God knows when I shall have strength for my bigger book.—</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that you keep your health; I suppose that you will be thinking of returning soon with your magnificent collection &amp; still grander mental materials. You will be puzzled how to publish. The Royal Soc. fund will be worth your consideration.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>With every good wish, pray believe me, | Yours very sincerely | Charles Darwin</p>
<p>I think that I told you before that Hooker is a complete convert. If I can convert Huxley I shall be content.—</p>
