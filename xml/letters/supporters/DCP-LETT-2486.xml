<p>It was very good of you to write about the Flint tools.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I feel an uncommon idle curiosity on subject, &amp; last night said to Emma how I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. like to write to you to enquire; but refrained not to give you trouble of answering. I shall look with extreme interest to what you say at Aberdeen: it will be a grand subject for you.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> No one, as far as I have seen, has discussed under what circumstances the beds were deposited. Are the beds like those with angular flints at Greenstreet Green, where Lubbock found Elephant remains, &amp; subsequently head of Musk ox?<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Do you remember telling me that you thought that they were glacial, &amp; afterwards enquiring of Arctic travellers about nature of the beach in those icy regions; &amp; now that musk-ox has been found, the story is complete. I have often told it with striking effect.— What ages Men must have lived on the old icy shores to have lost so many weapons! Esquimaux living on beach &amp; on sea &amp; on ice would be likely to lose more than any other races, &amp; have them embedded. It is a grand case, &amp; I am so glad you have investigated it.—</p>
<p>I am very glad you wish to see my clean sheets; I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. have offered them, but did not know whether it would bore you; I wrote by this mornings post to Murray to send them.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Unfortunately I have not got to part which would interest you, I think, most, &amp; which tells most in favour of view: viz Geological Succession— Geographical Distribution, &amp; especially Morphology, Embryology &amp; Rudimentary organs. I will see that the remaining sheets, when printed off, are sent to you. But would you like for me to send <hi rend="underline">last</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline">perfect</hi> Revises of the sheets, as I correct them?; if so, <hi rend="underline">send me your address in blank envelope</hi>.—</p>
<p>I hope that you will read all, whether dull (specially latter part of Ch. 2.) or not, for I am convinced there is not a sentence which has not bearing on whole argument.— You will find Ch. IV perplexing &amp; unintelligble, without the aid of enclosed queer Diagram, of which I send old &amp; useless proof.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I have, as Murray says, corrected so heavily as almost to have rewritten it; but yet I fear it is poorly written. Parts are intricate; &amp; I do not think that even you could make them quite clear. Do not, I beg, be in a hurry in committing yourself, (like so many naturalists) to go a certain length &amp; no further; for I am deeply convinced, that it is absolutely necessary to go whole <hi rend="doubleUnderline">vast</hi> length, or stick to creation of each separate species; I argue this point briefly in the last chapter. Remember that your verdict will probably have more influence than my Book in deciding whether such views as I hold, will be admitted or rejected at present,—in the future I cannot doubt about their admittance, &amp; our posterity will marvel as much about the current belief as we do about fossil-shells having been thought to have been created as we now see them.— But forgive me for running on about my hobby-horse.—</p>
<p>You ask about our healths; I cannot give a very flourishing account of Emma or of some of the children; and for myself I am in a very poor way, &amp; quite worn out, &amp; useless for everything. Immediately my last proof is done in 14 or 20 days; we start for 2 months’ Hydropathy &amp; rest—&amp; perhaps that will make a man of me.—</p>
<p>Give our kindest remembrances to Lady Lyell &amp; my dear Master | Yours affectionately | C. Darwin</p>
<p>I have read some of Hookers Introduction to Australian Flora, &amp; he gives up species in grand style.</p>
<p>I enclose P.S. of letter from Wallace lately received.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
