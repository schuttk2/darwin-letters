<p>My dear Huxley</p>
<p>I must thank you for your note, which made me laugh heartily.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> On my honour bright I did not look at you as the venerable figure which you pourtray.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> What I meant was that a long course of work, which the young are only likely to do, will be necessary to confirm my views, if they are ever to be confirmed. I did however fancy that you had got to think the probability less, which did not surprise me, as I used formerly myself to fluctuate in extreme degree.—   You may guess, therefore, how your note has pleased me.—   I am too sensitive of a <hi rend="underline">shade</hi> of opinion in such men as you, but I find I can now honestly say that I care nothing about common reviewers. You will be a real good Christian if you do not hate me, as you are so “pounded” on opposite sides.—</p>
<p>I have read few first pages of the Macmillans article,<ref target="#foot.f4"/> &amp; it pleases me that he quotes Mill’s Logic &amp; declares that I have philosophised in right spirit, &amp; that all the talk about Baconian induction is cant &amp; rubbish.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I well remember that you took nearly same line &amp; cited undulatory theory of light.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>Here I am again running on about my wearisome self.—   Farewell my best of defenders &amp; friends. I hope that M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Huxley is going on pretty well.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/> Do not work too hard; I am always fearful that you will break down with so many irons in the fire.—</p>
<p>Adios | C. Darwin</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">P.S.</hi> I have just reread your note. What a fool old Gray is (not but what I like him);<ref target="#foot.f8"/> he understands my book no more than a pig does. He told me the last time I saw him “you see natural selection cannot possibly apply to plants”.—   As far as accurate &amp; extended knowledge &amp; acute philosophy go, he would be a precious deal nearer the truth, if he were to say “old Huxley” &amp; “young Darwin”.</p>
<p>I see Fawett in Macmillan bring in you &amp; the B. of Oxfords Ape! You must see how well he praises your rejoinder.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f9">Expressing his surprise that opponents had not discussed the ‘most formidable argument’ against CD’s theory, namely geology, Fawcett stated: ‘It was sad, indeed, to think that the opponents of the theory sought to supply this omission by summoning to their aid a species of oratory which could deem it an argument to ask a professor if he should object to discover that he had been developed out of an ape.’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2471.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Fawcett 1860</ref>, pp. 88).
