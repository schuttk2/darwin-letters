<p>Believes that, in <hi rend="italic">Dicentra</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Fumaria</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Corydalis</hi>, flower structures are related directly to visits from bees. Flower stigmas generally are placed in the path of bees.</p> 
            <p>Has received paper from Wallace on natural selection; has sent abstract of his notions, with Wallace’s paper, to Linnean Society.</p>

<p>I have not answered your note of May 21 for I have had death &amp; illness &amp; misery amongst my children.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> And we are all going immediately from home for some weeks.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>With respect to Dicentra it is really pretty to watch the Humble Bees sucking first on one or the other side of the several flowers; with their hind legs resting on the crests of the hood formed by the inner united petals they push it to opposite side of flower, &amp; the straight pistil is rubbed against their abdomens &amp; inner side of thighs, which are <hi rend="underline">white with pollen</hi> from the several flowers. It is impossible but what the individuals of Dicentra must be largely crossed. Your Adlumia has not flowered with me yet. In Fumaria &amp; Corydalis we have another structure, viz nectary on one side &amp; here the pistil bends so that the 2 stigmas are presented in the gangway to the one nectary; &amp; the hood slips off easiest in opposite direction, instead of equally easily to either side.  [DIAGRAM HERE] Hood Dicentra nectary nectary Fumaria &amp; Corydalis nectary Indeed, in Corydalis lutea it almost springs off, &amp; the pistil decidedly springs towards the nectary-bearing petal. I have observed only 6 Fumariaceæ, &amp; I wish that I knew whether the rule was general; for I must believe that the structure of these flowers is related directly to the visits of Bees.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I <hi rend="underline">suspect</hi> from my own few observations that the following rule may be gen-eralised (&amp; I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. much like to know whether it is true) that when honey is secreted on one point of circle of corolla, the pistil <hi rend="underline">if it bends</hi>, always bends so that the stigmas, when mature, lie in the gangway to nectary. Thus in Columbine where there is a circle of nectaries, the stigmas are straight; in Aquilegia grandiflora where there is one nectary, the stigmas are rectangularly bent so that every Bee (as I this day saw) brushes over them in extracting the honey.—</p>
<p>It is very unlikely, but if by any chance you have my little sketch of my notions of “natural Selection” &amp; would see whether it or my letter bears any date, I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be very much obliged.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Why I ask this, is as follows. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Wallace who is now exploring New Guinea, has sent me an abstract of the same theory, most curiously coincident even in expressions.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> And he could never have heard a word of my views. He directed me to forward it to Lyell.— Lyell who is acquainted with my notions consulted with Hooker, (who read a dozen years ago a <hi rend="underline">long</hi> sketch of mine written in 1844) urged me with much kindness not to let myself to be quite forestalled &amp; to allow them to publish with Wallace’s paper an abstract of mine; &amp; as the only very brief thing which I had written out was a copy of my letter to you, I sent it and, I believe, it has just been read, (though never written, &amp; not fit for such purpose) before the Linnean Soc<hi rend="superscript">y</hi>.;<ref target="#foot.f6"/> &amp; this is the reason, why I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be glad of the date. But do not hunt for it, as I am sure it was written in September, October or November of last year.—</p>
<p>I have troubled you with a long story on this head; so pray forgive me &amp; believe me | Yours very sincerely | C. Darwin.—</p>
<p>P.S | In regard to bent pistils &amp; nectaries, I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. say that I largely judge of position of nectary, by seeing where Bees suck; according to this, the rule holds in all Leguminosæ, in my 6 Fumariaceæ, in Polygala.—Viola tricolor, Dictamnus Æsculus, Rhododendron—Aquilegia.</p>
