            <p>Henry Holland and others have attacked his reasoning from analogy to one primordial created form – by which CD means only that we know nothing of how life originated. The reasoning seems probable to him, so he has kept it in.</p>

<p>One part of your note has pleased me so much that I must thank you for it. Not only Sir H. H. but several others have attacked me about analogy leading to belief in one primordial <hi rend="doubleUnderline">created</hi> form.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> (By which I mean only that we know nothing as yet how life originates). I thought I was universally condemned on this head.— But I answered, that though perhaps it would have been more prudent not to have put it in, I would not strike it out, as it seemed to me probable &amp; I give it on no other grounds.— You will see in your mind the kind of arguments which made me think it probable; &amp; no one fact had so great an effect on me, as your most curious remarks on the apparent homologies of the heads of Vertebrata &amp; Articulata.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>You have done a real good turn in the Agency business (I never before heard of a hard-working unpaid agent besides yourself) in talking with Sir H. H; for he will have great influence over many. He floored me from my ignorance about bones of Ear,<ref target="#foot.f4"/> &amp;I made a mental note to ask you what the facts were.—</p>
<p>With hearty thanks &amp; real admiration for your generous zeal for the subject.— | Yours most truly | C. Darwin</p>
<p>You may smile about the care &amp; precautions I have taken about my ugly M.S.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> It is not so much the value I set on them; but the remembrance of the intolerable labour, for instance in tracing the History of the Breeds of Pigeons.—</p>
