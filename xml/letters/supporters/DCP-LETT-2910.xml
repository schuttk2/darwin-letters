<p>My dear Gray</p>
<p>On receipt (through Hooker) of your letter of Aug. 26<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. ,<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I ordered my Bookseller to send you Hopkins’ 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. article in Fraser; it was very stupid in me not to have thought of sending it &amp; the Quarterly.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> But I presume the Quarterly will have long ago arrived in the States. I have ordered Murray to send the “Origin” to the American Acad. of Sciences, to your care, as I did not know proper address; I shall be grateful for volumes. Many thanks for the sheets replacing those sent to Athenæum.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I sent the copy of this Athenæum at Lyell’s request to him in Germany (where he is fossil-man hunting) &amp; he writes to me that he thinks the argument by you quite admirable.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I have not yet recived the papers mentioned in your letter sent to Hooker, for H. first lent them to Lady H.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/> You will have heard of Hooker’s astonishing expedition to Syria; if he ascends Lebanon, it may answer scientifically, but I cannot help thinking the expedition rather rash.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> His absence is so great a loss to me, that I am hardly fair judge of the wisdom of the Journey. I have got, nevertheless, your second article in Atlantic monthly;<ref target="#foot.f8"/> for a copy of whole number was sent to my Brother-in-law Hensleigh Wedgwood, on account of a Review of his Dictionary.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> Do you know who the writer is, as my Brother would like to know??</p>
<p>I have ordered another copy of this August number, as I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. like (if I can get it in London) to send copy to Pictet;<ref target="#foot.f10"/> &amp; I have been thinking &amp; shall consult Huxley, whether I could not get it reprinted in some English Journal.—<ref target="#foot.f11"/> I have, also, ordered by anticipation two copies of October number; so do not trouble yourself to send it.<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
<p>By the way I am thinking of taking a very great liberty; but after much consideration I do not think you can object: you said that <hi rend="underline">it was known that you were the author of the 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>. article</hi>;<ref target="#foot.f13"/> &amp; as the best chance of getting it reprinted in England in a scientific Journal w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be to affix your name, I think of doing this &amp; I hope to Heaven that you will not think this an unwarrantable liberty. I think most highly of this Article &amp; I cannot bear to think it sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. not be known in England. You will be weary of my praise; but it does strike me as quite admirably argued; &amp; so well &amp; pleasantly written.— Your many metaphors are inimitably good. I said in a former letter that you were a Lawyer; but I made a gross mistake, I am sure that you are a poet. No by Jove I will tell you what you are, a hybrid, a complex cross of Lawyer, Poet, Naturalist, &amp; Theologian!—   Was there ever such a monster seen before? I have just looked through the passages which I have marked as appearing to me extra good, but I see that they are too numerous to specify; &amp; this is no exaggeration. My eye just alights on the happy comparison of colours of prism &amp; our artificial groups.—<ref target="#foot.f14"/> I see one little error of fossil <hi rend="underline">cattle</hi> in S. America.—<ref target="#foot.f15"/> It is curious how each one, I suppose weighs arguments in a different balance: embryology is to me by far strongest single class of facts in favour of change of form, &amp; not one, I think, of my reviewers has alluded to this. Variations not coming on at a very early age, &amp; being inherited at not very early corresponding period, explains, as it seems to me, the grandest of all facts in Nat. History, or rather in Zoology. viz the resemblance of Embryos.—<ref target="#foot.f16"/></p>
<p>Hensleigh Wedgwood, above alluded to, is a very strong Theist, &amp; I put it to him, whether he thought that each time a fly was snapped up by a swallow, its death was designed; &amp; he admitted he did not believe so, only that God ordered general laws &amp; left the result to what may be so far called chance, that there was no design in the death of each individual Fly.—</p>
<p>Farewell my good Friend | Yours most truly | Charles Darwin</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Never</hi> write to me when too much pressed by labour,—though I value much your letters.—</p>
