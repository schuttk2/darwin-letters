<p>I send by this post 4 corrected sheets.— The sheet with the whale-case has been printed off.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I have altered sentence about eocene fauna being beaten by recent, thanks to your remark.— But I imagined that it would have been clear that I supposed the climate to be nearly similar:<ref target="#foot.f3"/> you do not doubt, I imagine, that the climate of eocene &amp; recent periods in <hi rend="underline">different</hi> parts of world could be matched. Not that I think climate nearly so important as most naturalists seem to think. In my opinion no error is more mischievous than this.</p>
<p>I was very glad to find that Hooker who read over in M.S. my geographical chapters, quite agreed in the view of the greater importance of organic relations. I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. like you to consider p. 77 &amp; reflect on case of any organism in midst of its range.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I shall be curious hereafter to hear what you think of Distribution during Glacial &amp; preceding warmer period.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I am so glad that you do not think Chapt. on Imperfection of Geolog. Record exaggerated; I was more fearful about this Chapt, than about any part—</p>
<p>Embryology in Ch. XIII is one of my strongest points, I think.— But I must not bore you by running on. My mind is so wearisomely full of subject.—</p>
<p>I do thank you for your euloge at Aberdeen.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I have been so wearied &amp; exhausted of late, that I have for months doubted whether I have not been throwing away time &amp; labour for nothing. But now I care not what the universal world says; I have always found you right, &amp; certainly on this occasion I am not going to doubt for the first time.— Whether you go far or but a very short way with me &amp; others who believe as I do, I am contented, for my work cannot be in vain— You would laugh if you knew how often I have read your paragraph, &amp; it has acted like a little dram.—</p>
<p>I start for  Ilkley Wells House Otley Yorkshire on Sept. 29<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, &amp; shall get there, on Oct. 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> <ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>Farewell | C. Darwin</p>
<p>Pray give our kindest remembrances to Lady Lyell.—</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f2">Lyell had told CD of a mistake about fossil whales having been discovered in Secondary formations (<ref target="./DCP-LETT-2492.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Charles Lyell, 20 September [1859]</ref>). The error was published unchanged in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref>, p. 304.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">The sentence occurs in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref>, p. 337: ‘If under a nearly similar climate, the eocene inhabitants of one quarter of the world were put into competition with the existing inhabitants of the same or some other quarter, the eocene fauna or flora would certainly be beaten and exterminated’. CD apparently added the qualifying phrase ‘under a nearly similar climate’.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">CD refers to a passage in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref>, pp. 77–8, that emphasises the relative unimportance of adaptation to climate: <quote> Look at a plant in the midst of its range, why does it not double or quadruple its numbers? We know that it can perfectly well withstand a little more heat or cold, dampness or dryness, for elsewhere it ranges into slightly hotter or colder, damper or drier districts. In this case we can clearly see that if we wished in imagination to give the plant the power of increasing in number, we should have to give it some advantage over its competitors, or over the animals which preyed on it.</quote></note>

            <note xml:id="foot.f6">In his opening address to the geology section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in Aberdeen (14–21 September 1859), Lyell stated that CD ‘appears to me to have succeeded, by his investigations and reasonings, in throwing a flood of light on many classes of phenomena connected with the affinities, geographical distribution, and geological succession of organic beings, for which no other hypothesis has been able, or has even attempted, to account.’ (<hi rend="italic">Athenæum</hi>, 24 September 1859, p. 404). Lyell had read the proof-sheets of the first half of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref> a few weeks earlier (see letters to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3051.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Charles Lyell</ref>, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-2486.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">2 September [1859]</ref>, and to John Murray, 2 September [1859]). There is a copy of the privately printed version of Lyell’s address in the Darwin Pamphlet Collection–CUL. The speech was later published in the British Association <hi rend="italic">Report</hi> (C. Lyell 1859b).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f7">CD’s plans changed: he did not set out for Ilkley until 2 October 1859 (‘Journal’; Appendix II). See also <ref target="./DCP-LETT-2496.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Charles Lyell, 30 September [1859]</ref>.</note>
