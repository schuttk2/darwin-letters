<p>My dear Lyell</p>
<p>I thank you much for your letter.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I had got to take pleasure in thinking how I could best snub my Reviewers; but I was determined in any case to follow your advice, &amp; before I had got to the end of your letter I was convinced of the wisdom of your advice.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> What an advantage it is to me to have such friend as you.— I shall follow every hint in your letter exactly.—</p>
<p>I have just heard from Murray; he says he sold 700 copies at his sale, &amp; that he has not half the number to supply; so that I must begin at once.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> But I will &amp; must finish my Drosera M.S. which will take me a week, for at this present moment I care more about Drosera than the origin of all the species in the world. But I will not publish on Drosera till next year, for I am frightened &amp; astounded at my results.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I declare it is a certain fact, that one organ is so sensitive to touch that a weight of <hi rend="superscript">1/78,000</hi> of a grain (ie seventy-eight times less weight than that, viz <formula><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>1000</mn></mfrac></math></formula> of a grain, which will move the best chemical balance) suffices to cause conspicuous movement.—   Is it not curious that a plant sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be far more sensitive to a touch than any nerve in the human body! Yet I am perfectly sure that this is true.— When I am on my hobby-horse, I never can resist telling my friends, how well my hobby goes, so you must forgive the rider.—</p>
<p>Farewell my wisest &amp; best of Lord Chancellors.</p>
<p>Yours most truly obliged | C. Darwin</p>
<p>Etty goes on pretty well. All the Doctors say any rapid progress is impossible.—</p>
<p>All this dreadful illness for last six months (&amp; that wicked dear little Drosera) has made any progress in my larger Book almost nothing—</p>
<p>P.S. I must tell you one little fact which has pleased me. You may remember that I adduce Electrical Organs of Fish, as one of the greatest difficulties which had occurred to me, &amp; Owen notices the passage in a singularly disingenous spirit.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> Well M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>.Donnell of Dublin (first rate man) writes to me that he felt the difficulty of whole case as overwhelming against me.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> Not only are the fishes which have electric organs very remote in scale; but the organ is near Head in some &amp; near tail in others &amp; supplied by wholly different nerves.—   It seems impossible that there could be any transition.</p>
<p>Some friend who is much opposed to me seems to have crowed over M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>.Donnell, who reports that he said to himself that if Darwin is right there must be homologous organs both near the Head &amp; Tail in other non-electric fish. He set to work &amp; by Jove he has found them. So that some of difficulty is removed, &amp; is it not satisfactory that my hypothetical notions sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> have lead to pretty discovery. M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>.Donnell seems very cautious; he says years must pass before he will venture to call himself a believer in my doctrine; but that on the subjects which he knows well viz morphology &amp; embryology my views accord well &amp; throw light on whole subject.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>

Wilberforce had been primed on the scientific objections to CD’s views by <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3629.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Richard Owen</ref>. The passage reads, in part: ‘We see no possible solution on the Darwinian theory for the presence at once so marked and so exceptional of these organs.’ Wilberforce went on to state that CD’s confession of ignorance was ‘a solution which could of course equally make the scheme it is intended to serve compatible with any other contradiction.’ There is an annotated copy of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8372.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">[Wilberforce] 1860</ref> in the Darwin Pamphlet Collection–CUL.</note>
