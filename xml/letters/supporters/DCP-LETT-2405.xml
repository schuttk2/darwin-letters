                <div type="transcription">
<p>I was extremely much pleased at receiving three days ago your letter to me &amp; that to D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Hooker.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Permit me to say how heartily I admire the spirit in which they are written. Though I had absolutely nothing whatever to do in leading Lyell &amp; Hooker to what they thought a fair course of action, yet I naturally could not but feel anxious to hear what your impression would be. I owe indirectly much to you &amp; them; for I almost think that Lyell would have proved right &amp; I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. never have completed my larger work, for I have found my abstract hard enough with my poor health, but now thank God I am in my last chapter, but one.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> My abstract will make a small vol. of 400 or 500 pages.— Whenever published, I will of course send you a copy, &amp; then you will see what I mean about the part which I believe Selection has played with domestic productions. It is a very different part, as you suppose, from that played by “Natural Selection”.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I sent off, by same address as this note, a copy of Journal of Linn. Soc. &amp; subsequently I have sent some <formula><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></math></formula> dozen copies of the Paper.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I have many other copies at your disposal; &amp; I sent two to your friend D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Davies(?) author of works on men’s skulls.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>I am glad to hear that you have been attending to Bird’s nest; I have done so, though almost exclusively under one point of view, viz to show that instincts vary, so that selection could work on &amp; improve them.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> Few other instincts, so to speak, can be preserved in a museum—</p>
<p>Many thanks for your offer to look after Horses stripes; if there are any Donkey’s pray add them.—</p>
<p>I am delighted to hear that you have collected Bees’ combs; when next in London I will enquire of F. Smith &amp; M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Saunders.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> This is an especial hobby of mine, &amp; I think I can throw light on subject.— If you can collect duplicates at no very great expence, I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be glad of specimens for myself with some Bees of each kind.—<ref target="#foot.f9"/> Young growing &amp; irregular combs, &amp; those which have not had pupæ are most valuable for measurements &amp; examination: their edges sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be well protected against abrasion.—</p>
<p>Everyone whom I have seen has thought your paper very well written &amp; interesting. It puts my extracts, (written in 1839 now just 20 years ago!)<ref target="#foot.f10"/> which I must say in apology were never for an instant intended for publication, in the shade.</p>
<p>You ask about Lyell’s frame of mind. I think he is somewhat staggered, but does not give in, &amp; speaks with horror often to me, of what a thing it would be &amp; what a job it would be for the next Edition of Principles, if he were “<hi rend="underline">per</hi>verted”.— But he is most candid &amp; honest &amp; I think will end by being <hi rend="underline">per</hi>verted.— D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Hooker has become almost as heteredox as you or I.—and I look at Hooker as <hi rend="doubleUnderline">by far</hi> the most capable judge in Europe.—</p>
<p>Most cordially do I wish you health &amp; entire success in all your pursuits &amp; God knows if admirable zeal &amp; energy deserve success, most amply do you deserve it.</p>
<p>I look at my own career as nearly run out: if I can publish my abstract &amp; perhaps my greater work on same subject, I shall look at my course as done.<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
<p>Believe me, my dear Sir | Yours very sincerely | C. Darwin</p>
