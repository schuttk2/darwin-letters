<p>Again I have to thank you for one of your very pleasant letters (of May 7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>), enclosing a very pleasant remittance of 22£.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I am in simple truth astonished at all the kind trouble you have taken for me. I return Appleton’s account.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> For the chance of your wishing for a formal acknowledgment, I send one.—   If you have any further communication to the Appletons pray express my acknowledgment for his generosity; for it is generosity in my opinion. I am not at all surprised at sale diminishing: my extreme surprise is at greatness of sale. No doubt the public has been <hi rend="underline">shamefully</hi> imposed on! for they bought the book, thinking that it would be nice easy reading. I expect the sale to stop soon in England: yet Lyell wrote to me the other day that calling at Murrays he heard that 50 copies had gone in previous 48 hours.—   I am extremely glad that you will notice in Silliman additions in the Origin.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Judging from letters (&amp; I have just seen one from Thwaites to Hooker) &amp; from remarks, the most serious omission in my book was not explaining how it is, as I believe, that all forms do not necessarily advance,—how there can now be <hi rend="underline">simple</hi> organisms still existing.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> The article in Med. &amp; Chirurg. Review is by Carpenter.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I would send Pictet’s, if you cannot see it, but I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. require it back.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/> Sedgwick has been firing broadsides into me, but exclusively on geological grounds.— Prof. Clarke of Cambridge says publickly that the chief characteristic of such books as mine is their “consummate impudence”.—<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>I hear there is <hi rend="doubleUnderline">very</hi> severe review on me in North British by a Rev<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dunns,<ref target="#foot.f9"/> a free-Kirk minister &amp; dabbler in Nat. Hist<hi rend="superscript">y</hi>.    I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be very glad to see any good American Reviews,—as they are all more or less useful.— You say that you shall touch on other Reviews.—<ref target="#foot.f10"/> Huxley told me some time ago that after a time he would write review on all Reviews, whether he will I know not.—   If you allude to Edinburgh, pray notice <hi rend="underline">some</hi> of the points which I will point out on separate slip.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> In “Saturday Review” (one of our cleverest periodicals) of May 5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. p. 573 there is a nice article on Owen’s Review, defending Huxley, but not Hooker; &amp; the latter I think Owen treats most ungenerously.—<ref target="#foot.f12"/> But surely you will get sick unto death of me &amp; my Reviewers.—</p>
<p>With respect to the theological view of the question; this is always painful to me.— I am bewildered.— I had no intention to write atheistically. But I own that I cannot see, as plainly as others do, &amp; as I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> wish to do, evidence of design &amp; beneficence on all sides of us. There seems to me too much misery in the world. I cannot persuade myself that a beneficent &amp; omnipotent God would have designedly created the Ichneumonidæ with the express intention of their feeding within the living bodies of caterpillars, or that a cat should play with mice. Not believing this, I see no necessity in the belief that the eye was expressly designed. On the other hand I cannot anyhow be contented to view this wonderful universe &amp; especially the nature of man, &amp; to conclude that everything is the result of brute force. I am inclined to look at everything as resulting from designed laws, with the details, whether good or bad, left to the working out of what we may call chance. Not that this notion <hi rend="underline">at all</hi> satisfies me. I feel most deeply that the whole subject is too profound for the human intellect. A dog might as well speculate on the mind of Newton.—   Let each man hope &amp; believe what he can.—</p>
<p>Certainly I agree with you that my views are not at all necessarily atheistical. The lightning kills a man, whether a good one or bad one, owing to the excessively complex action of natural laws,—a child (who may turn out an idiot) is born by action of even more complex laws,—and I can see no reason, why a man, or other animal, may not have been aboriginally produced by other laws; &amp; that all these laws may have been expressly designed by an omniscient Creator, who foresaw every future event &amp; consequence. But the more I think the more bewildered I become; as indeed I have probably shown by this letter.</p>
<p>Most deeply do I feel your generous kindness &amp; interest.—</p>
<p>Yours sincerely &amp; cordially | Charles Darwin</p>

<p>p. 489. I think I told you of the illiberality of Owen about the Branchiæ; he having in independent works fully admitted that the Branchiæ were Branchiæ<ref target="#foot.f15"/></p>
<p>496    what a quibble to pretend he did not understand what I meant by <hi rend="underline">inhabitants</hi> of S. America: &amp; anyone would suppose that I had not throughout my volume touched on Geograph. Distrib. He ignores also everything which I have said on Classification, Geological Succession. <hi rend="underline">Homologies</hi>, Embryology &amp; Rudimentary Organs.</p>
<p>500    He falsely applies what I said (too rudely) about “blindness of preconceived opinions” to those who believe in creation; whereas I exclusively apply the remark to those who give up multitudes of species as true species, but believe in remainder.—</p>
<p>p. 501. He slightly alters what I say.—   I <hi rend="doubleUnderline">ask</hi> whether creationist really believe that elemental atoms have flashed into life. He says I describe them as so believing; &amp; this surely is a difference.—</p>
<p>501. He speaks of my “clamouring against” all who believe in creation: &amp; this seems to me an unjust accusation.</p>
<p>512. It is a good joke that the Reviewer is so full of Owens work that he refers to “On the Nature of the Limbs”, when he means to refer to my book &amp; give right page; but alters the quotation.</p>
<p>522— He makes me say that the Dorsal vertebræ vary— this is simply false: I nowhere say a word about dorsal vertebræ.</p>
<p>525. What an illiberal sentence that is about “any pretension to candour” &amp; about my rushing through barriers which stopped Cuvier: such an argument would stop any progress in science.</p>
<p>530    How disingenuous to quote from my remarks to you about my <hi rend="underline">brief</hi> letter, as if it applied to whole subject.</p>
<p>530. How disingenuous to say that we are called on to accept the theory from the imperfection of geological Record, when I over &amp; over again how grave a difficulty the imperfection offers.—</p>
<p>519. How often that abominable arctic Bear has been made to worry me; but Owen is false, when he says that the case has no application, as put in my 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. Edit, for it certainly well illustrates “diversified &amp; changed habits” of life.—</p>
