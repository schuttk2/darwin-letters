<p>Will forward ARW’s "<hi rend="italic">admirable</hi>" paper to Linnean Society ["On the zoological geography of the Malay Archipelago", <hi rend="italic">J. Linn. Soc. Lond. (Zool.)</hi> 4 (1860): 172–84].</p> 
            <p>Discusses geographical distribution of animals in the Malay Archipelago; relation of distribution to depth of sea between islands.</p>
            <p>Relation of Celebes to Africa almost passes belief.</p>
            <p>Differs wholly from ARW on colonisation of oceanic islands; does not believe in Forbes’s great continental extensions.</p>
            <p>Anticipates Owen’s opposition to their views, but "he is a poor reasoner &amp; deeply considers the good opinion of the world, especially the aristocratic world".</p>

<p>I received your letter &amp; memoir on the 7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> &amp; will forward it tomorrow to Linn. Soc<hi rend="superscript">y</hi>. <ref target="#foot.f1"/> But you will be aware that there is no meeting till beginning of November. Your paper seems to me <hi rend="underline">admirable</hi> in matter, style &amp; reasoning; &amp; I thank you for allowing me to read it. Had I read it some months ago I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. have profited by it for my forthcoming volume.— But my two chapters on this subject are in type; &amp; though not yet corrected, I am so wearied out &amp; weak in health, that I am fully resolved not to add one word &amp; merely improve style. So you will see that my views are nearly the same with yours, &amp; you may rely on it that not one word shall be altered owing to my having read your ideas.</p>
<p>Are you aware that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> W. Earl published several years ago the view of distribution of animals in Malay Archipelago in relation to the depth of the sea between the islands?<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I was much struck with this &amp; have been in habit of noting all facts on distribution in that Archipelago &amp; elswhere in this relation. I have been led to conclude that there has been a good deal of naturalisation in the different Malay islands &amp; which I have thought to certain extent would account for anomalies. Timor has been my greatest puzzle. What do you say to the peculiar Felis there?<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I wish that you had visited Timor:<ref target="#foot.f4"/> it has been asserted that fossil Mastodon or Elephant’s tooth (I forget which) has been found there, which would be grand fact.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I was aware that Celebes was very peculiar; but the relation to Africa is quite new to me &amp; marvellous &amp; almost passes belief.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/> It is as anomalous as relation of <hi rend="underline">plants</hi> in S.W. Australia to Cape of Good Hope.</p>
<p>I differ <hi rend="doubleUnderline">wholly</hi> from you on colonisation of <hi rend="underline">oceanic</hi> islands, but you will have <hi rend="doubleUnderline">everyone</hi> else on your side.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I quite agree with respect to all islands not situated far in ocean. I quite agree on little occasional intermigration between lands when once pretty well stocked with inhabitants, but think this does not apply to rising &amp; ill-stocked islands.</p>
<p>Are you aware that <hi rend="underline">annually</hi> birds are blown to Madeira, to Azores, (&amp; to Bermuda from America).—<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I wish I had given fuller abstract of my reasons for not believing in Forbes’ great continental extensions;<ref target="#foot.f9"/> but it is too late, for I will alter nothing. I am worn out &amp; must have rest.—</p>
<p>Owen, I do not doubt, will bitterly oppose us; but I regard this very little; as he is a poor reasoner &amp; deeply considers the good opinion of the world, especially the aristocratic world.—<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
<p>Hooker is publishing a grand Introduction to Flora of Australia &amp; goes the whole length.—<ref target="#foot.f11"/> I have seen proofs of about half.—</p>
<p>With every good wish. Believe me | Yours very sincerely | C. Darwin</p>
<p>Excuse this brief note, but I am far from well.—</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">Wallace’s letter has not been found. The memoir was on the zoological geography of the Malay Archipelago. CD communicated the paper to the <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2944.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Linnean Society</ref>; it was read at a meeting on3 November 1859 (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8066.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Wallace 1860</ref>).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">In <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref>, p. 395, CD cited George Windsor Earl’s observations (Earl 1853) that the two widely distinct mammalian faunas in the Malay Archipelago were separated by a stretch of deep ocean. CD believed that deep ocean separating oceanic islands from each other or from the mainland indicated that the islands had not formerly been connected to another landmass, and hence that many mammals would not have been able to disperse over the area.

            <note xml:id="foot.f3">The indigenous cats of Timor, characterised by tails in which the end-joints were crooked, are mentioned in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2235.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Earl 1837</ref>, p. 233. CD read this work in 1838 (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 4, Appendix IV,119: 3a) and noted the tail peculiarity in Notebook E, pp. 18–19 and 182 (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5912.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Notebooks</hi></ref>).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">Wallace visited Timor in May 1859 and again from January to April 1861, but both times he was disappointed, the ‘country round proving almost a desert for a collector’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8126.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Wallace 1905</ref>, 1: 369, 375).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">In Notebook E, p. 173 (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5912.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Notebooks</hi></ref>), CD wrote: ‘M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Greenough on his Map of the World, has. written. Mastodon found at Timor.— thinks he has seen specimen at Paris Museum.—’ <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1969.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">George Bellas Greenough</ref> had formed ‘a collection of maps, upon which or in his note-books he entered all the geological data he could obtain from travellers and from books.’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2063.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">DNB</hi></ref>). Greenough’s maps were at the <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1841.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Geological Society of London</ref>.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f6">Wallace had noticed several genera on Celebes that were otherwise confined to Africa or other areas outside the archipelago (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8066.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Wallace 1860</ref>, pp. 176–7).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f7">Wallace favoured the view that islands usually received their flora and fauna via land connections that had previously existed between neighbouring countries. CD, on the other hand, believed that occasional ‘accidental’ means of dispersal (such as the transport of seeds, eggs, and some organisms by wind, birds, or water) could account for the colonisation of islands. See <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 6, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-2192.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to A. R. Wallace, 22 December 1857</ref>.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f8">The letter was annotated by Wallace at this point. His note reads: ‘Birds can <hi rend="italic">make way</hi> to land when out of <hi rend="italic">course</hi> other animals and plants depend only on wind and current.’</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f9">CD briefly mentioned <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1680.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Edward Forbes’s</ref> theory of continental extensions in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref>, p. 357.
