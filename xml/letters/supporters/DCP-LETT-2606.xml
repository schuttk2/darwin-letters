<p>I have just read with <hi rend="underline">intense</hi> interest as far as p. xxvi. ie to where you treat of Australian Flora itself; &amp; the latter part I remember thinking most of in the proof-sheets.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> Either you have altered a good deal, or I did not see all or was purblind, for I have been much more interested, with all the first part than I was before, not that I did not like it at first. All seems to me very clearly written &amp; I have been baulked at only one sentence.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>I think on whole I like the Geological or rather palæontological discussion best; it seems to me excellent, &amp; admirably cautious: I agree with all that you say as far as my want of special knowledge allows me to judge.</p>
<p>I have no criticisms of any importance. But I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> have liked more facts in one or two places, which I shall ask about.— I rather demur to the fairness of your comparison of rising &amp; sinking areas; as in Indian ocean you compare volcanic land with exclusively coral islands—&amp; these latter are very small in area &amp; have very peculiar soil, &amp; during their formation are likely to have been utterly submerged, perhaps many times &amp; restocked with existing plants.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> In the Pacific, ignorance of Marianne &amp; <hi rend="underline">Caroline</hi> &amp; other chief islands almost prevents comparison: &amp; is it right to include American isl<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> like Juan Fernandez &amp; Galapagos?—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> In such lofty &amp; probably ancient isl<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> as Sandwich &amp; Tahiti, it cannot make much difference in flora, whether they have sunk or risen a few thousand feet of late ages.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> Gambier Isl w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be interesting case.</p>
<p>I wish you could work in your notion of certain parts of Tropics having kept hot, whilst other parts were cooled; I tried this scheme in my mind, &amp; it seemed to fail.— On the whole I like very much all that I have read of your Introduction, &amp; I cannot doubt that it will have great weight in converting other Botanists from the doctrine of immutable creation.— What a lot of matter there is one of your pages!</p>
<p>Ever yours affec<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> | C. Darwin</p>
<p>(There are many points I wish much to discuss with you.—)</p>
<p>How I wish you could work out Pacific Floras; I remember ages ago reading some of your M.S. In Paris there must be I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> think materials from French Voyages. But of all places in world I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> like to see good Flora of Sandwich Isl<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>.— I w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. subscribe <hi rend="superscript">£</hi>50 to any collector to go there &amp; work all the Islands. Would it not pay for collector to go there? especially if aided by any subscription. It would be a fair occasion to ask for aid from Government grant from Royal Soc<hi rend="superscript">y</hi>.— I think it is the most isolated group in world, &amp; the isl<hi rend="superscript">ds</hi>. themselves well isolated from each other.</p>
<p>PS.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> | With respect to Asa Gray (to whom I have written long letter, but I have not yet read Essay, a copy of which I found in London for me) I am not at all convinced about the warm period subsequent to Glacial period.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. not be at all sorry to see its truth proved; but until it be well established, I think its introduction complicates the subject &amp; does mischief.— This warmer period, <hi rend="underline">subsequent</hi> to Glacial, will not do for the introduction from old to new worlds (or conversely) of the many forms which now exist as distinct but representative species.— I hope you did not repeat to him anything ill-natured from my old letter:<ref target="#foot.f8"/> he seems rather vexed on subject.— He seems to be a real noble man.—</p>
<p>I was so busy that I did not notice your remarks on Greenland Flora in a former note.—<ref target="#foot.f9"/> They seem to me to work well in; but we must talk over this when we meet.—</p>
<p>You know Marten’s paper on gradual decrease in number of European species in going Westward from Europe toward America.—<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f4">CD made the same point in his copy of Hooker 1859, p. xvi: ‘Hardly facts enough known— some islands rather near continents included.— Marianne &amp; Caroline Is<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> s. ought to be included.— &amp; Gambier Isl<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>.’</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">CD wrote in his copy of Hooker 1859, p. xvi: ‘An isl<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> so lofty &amp; ancient as Tahiti, whether rising or sinking must have been long peopled.’ In the opposite margin he wrote: ‘I doubt whole case.’</note>
