<p>I got this to-day.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I send Appletons, now, the sheets of ed. 2, &amp; your additions appended in their places.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I promised the Historical Preface next week,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> and I put it in their hands— trusting to their <hi rend="underline">promise</hi> of 5 percent and to their honor for more if they are not molested by reprinters, which we shall keep off.</p>
<p>The offer of check for £50—(which I might send to Mrs. Darwin for pin-money, since you scorn it) tempts me,—but I think it wiser to wait and hope for more.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I mailed you a clean copy of my Review. I have sent it to Agassiz. He is childishly apt to be offended at any opposition, but I have, as you see been very careful to avoid all cause of personal offence.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>

<p>Yr favor of 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. is at hand. We cant say what we can do respecting the notes &amp; additions till we see them but we shall be anxious to make our edition conform to any future English Ed<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>You are under a mistake in supposing that new matter unpublished in England secures a copyright in this country if written by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Darwin—on the contrary if the entire work had never been published in England and first appeared here no copyright would hold in this country as no one can hold a copyright here for what he has written unless he be a citizen of the U.S—</p>
<p>We proposed to ourselves to pay 5% on retail price as suggested in yr letter as there is no reason why a work without any legal rights, sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> pay the same as one that is secured by law— We desire to act liberally altho‘ we printed the work after it had reached this country some little time; not having rec’d even early sheets which is usual when any payments are made.</p>
<p>We regret very much there is no protection to the foreign author, think it a monstrous shame, but we are obliged to take things as they actually exist— We are quite willing if it w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be agreeable to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Darwin to send him a check for 50£ stg. and very likely that will be as much as he could receive by the sales.</p>
<p>We remain | Very respectfully | D. Appleton &amp; Co</p>
