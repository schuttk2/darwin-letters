<p>My dear Lyell.</p>
<p>As Emma is writing to Lady Lyell,<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I will add a few line; though I have not much to say. I was in London lately for a couple of days,<ref target="#foot.f2"/> &amp; heard a piece of news, which if you have not heard of it, you will be sincerely sorry to hear. Sir G. Grey on his passage out,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> having some suspicion, after he was well engaged at whist, suddenly went to his wife’s cabin &amp; found her in bed with Capt. (or Admiral?) Keppell!<ref target="#foot.f4"/> The latter has staid at Rio &amp; what a despatch he must have written to explain to the Admiralty why he did not take on the Governor to the Cape. What a wreck of happiness for poor Sir George. No doubt she was formerly guilty in N. Zealand, when that examination about some Officer took place.—</p>
<p>The only scientific man I saw in London was Falconer, who goes to Sicily in October.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> He was very full about a tiny new species of Elephant from Malta not much larger than a calf!</p>
<p>The only Review worth notice, since I wrote is an <hi rend="underline">excellent</hi> argumentative one in the <hi rend="underline">August</hi> Monthly atlantic by Asa Gray.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> He is assuredly a first-rate arguer &amp; most completely understands the subject. I have been well abused in a Catholic Journal;<ref target="#foot.f7"/> but the writer assures his readers that the progress of Science does not in the least shake the authority of Moses. I was very glad to hear in London that the Rajah Sir J. Brooke is about again &amp; dining out,—a sort of resurrection.—<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I have been getting on a bit better with my work lately &amp; to day finished with Dogs;—&amp; it is rather a curious subject; &amp; I am confirmed in my belief that they have descended from several wild stocks.—</p>
<p>I sent you the Athenæum &amp; Quarterly Review, which I hope you received.—</p>
<p>Farewell. I fear that you will not be settled in London for some considerable time.—   Ever yours | C. Darwin</p>
