<p>I have received your letter of the 24<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. <ref target="#foot.f1"/> It is no use trying to thank you; your kindness is beyond thanks. I will certainly leave out Whale &amp; Bear.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>With respect to Pheasants crossing, I have inserted a sentence: in my fuller M.S. I have the case worked out at length. The Japan &amp; English pheasant are utterly dissimilar, &amp; the other two must be considered as close but distinct species. There is no doubt about their blending; but whether the exact half-bred birds would be <hi rend="underline">quite</hi> fertile <hi rend="underline">int se</hi> I could not make out. In whole districts our English pheasant P. Colchicus has, I think certainly been modified by crossing with P. torquatus.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>But as my M.S is at home I fear I can now add nothing, even if I had time. So it must be with mistaken instincts.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I should like to tell you one funny blunder in instinct of Wood ant, which I made out last summer. (No, it is too long story).—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>The Edition was 1250 copies. When I was in spirits I sometimes fancied that my book w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be successful; but I never even built a castle-in-the air of such success as it has met with; I do not mean the sale, but the impression it has made on you (whom I have always looked at as chief judge) &amp; Hooker &amp; Huxley. The whole has <hi rend="underline">infinitely</hi> exceeded my wildest hopes.—</p>
<p>Farewell.— I am tired for I have been going over the sheets.— My kind friend farewell | Yours | C. Darwin</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">Lyell’s letter has not been found.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">The passage occurs in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref>, p. 184: <quote> In North America the black bear was seen by Hearne swimming for hours with widely open mouth, thus catching, like a whale, insects in the water. Even in so extreme a case as this, … I can see no difficulty in a race of bears being rendered, by natural selection, more and more aquatic in their structure and habits, with larger and larger mouths, till a creature was produced as monstrous as a whale.</quote> In the second edition, CD inserted ‘almost’ before ‘like a whale’ in the first sentence and deleted the second sentence. CD later regretted having done so, but it was never restored in subsequent English editions (see Peckham ed. 1959, p. 333).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">Lyell had questioned CD closely on the implications for CD’s species theory of hybrid sterility and the laws of variation. See letters from <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3051.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Charles Lyell</ref>, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-2512A.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">28 October 1859</ref> and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-2540A.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">21 November 1859</ref>. CD discussed his views on the topic in his <ref target="./DCP-LETT-2543.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Charles Lyell, 23 November [1859]</ref>. In <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref>, p. 253, CD stated that pheasants were a genus in which hybrids were perfectly fertile. In the second edition, CD added an extra sentence: ‘There is no doubt that these three pheasants, namely, the common, the true ring-necked, and the Japan, intercross, and are becoming blended together in the woods of several parts of England.’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6015.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi> 2d ed.</ref>, p. 253; Peckham ed. 1959, p. 433).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">Lyell had offered several examples in response to CD’s remark in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref>, p. 211, that ‘certain instincts cannot be considered as absolutely perfect; but as details on this and other such points are not indispensable, they may be here passed over.’ See <ref target="./DCP-LETT-2551.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from Charles Lyell, [22 November 1859]</ref>.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">CD refers to observations of <hi rend="italic">Formica rufa</hi> made during his stay at Moor Park in July 1859. He saw large numbers of ants labouring to carry pupa-cases unnecessarily long distances from the nest, seemingly in mistaken imitation of the instinct for transporting pupae to new nests. His note describing this case, headed ‘July 23/59/’ and marked ‘Mistaken Instinct’, is in DAR 205.11 (2): 96.</note>
