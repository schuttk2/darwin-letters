<p>P.S. I have just read Quarterly R.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> It is uncommonly clever; picks out with skill all the most conjectural parts, &amp; brings forwards well all difficulties.—   It quizzes me quite splendidly by quoting the Anti-Jacobin versus my grandfather.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> You are not alluded to; nor, strange to say, Huxley, &amp; I can plainly see here &amp; there Owen’s hand.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> The concluding pages will make Lyell shake in his shoes. By Jove if he sticks to us he will be a real Hero.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>Good night—your well-quizzed, but not sorrowful &amp; affectionate friend. C.D.</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">Although the note was endorsed ‘July 23/60’ and then corrected in the same hand to read ‘July 26/60’, it seems likely that both dates are incorrect. The note was probably written before the letters to T. H. Huxley, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-2873.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">20 July [1860]</ref>, and to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3026.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">John Lubbock</ref>, 20 July [1860]. It could possibly have been enclosed with the preceding letter, but then CD would have had little time to obtain and read the review to which he refers. The <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review</hi> in question (see n. 2, below) was published on Wednesday, 18 July 1860 (<hi rend="italic">Publisher’s Circular</hi>, 17 July 1860, p. 339).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">The July issue of the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review</hi> carried an anonymous review of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref>. The author was <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_5128.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Samuel Wilberforce</ref>, bishop of Oxford (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8374.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Wilberforce 1874</ref>; <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8277.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Wellesley index</hi></ref> 1: 743). CD’s annotated offprint of the review is in the Darwin Pamphlet Collection–CUL. Errors noted on an erratum sheet in the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review</hi> have been corrected in the offprint. CD wrote in ink at the head: ‘Bishop of Oxford aided by Owen &amp; Murchison(?)’. He refers to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3629.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Richard Owen</ref> and <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3453.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Roderick Impey Murchison</ref>.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">CD refers to the following passage in the review (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8372.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">[Wilberforce] 1860</ref>, pp. 254–5): <quote type="quote"> We do not think that, with all his matchless ingenuity, Mr. Darwin has found any instance which so well illustrates his own theory of the improved descendant under the elevating influences of natural selection exterminating the progenitor whose specialities he has exaggerated as he himself affords us in this work. For if we go back two generations we find the ingenious grandsire of the author of the ‘Origin of Species’ speculating on the same subject, and almost in the same manner with his more daring descendant … Many of our readers will remember the humour with which Frere and Canning, in the ‘Poetry of the Anti-Jacobin,’ exposed these philosophical arguments of the last generation. </quote> The reference is to ‘Loves of the triangles’ a parody of Erasmus Darwin’s ‘Loves of the plants’, published in <hi rend="italic">Poetry of the Anti-Jacobin</hi> (1799), edited by <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1756.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">John Hookham Frere</ref>, <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_820.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">George Canning</ref>, and others.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">The reviewer quoted extensively from the works of <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3629.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Richard Owen</ref>, whose philosophy he found ‘just as much truer to nature as it is to revelation than all these speculations of the transmutationist.’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8372.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">[Wilberforce] 1860</ref>, p. 260).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5"><ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3051.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Charles Lyell’s</ref> attack on transmutation in his <hi rend="italic">Principles of</hi> <hi rend="italic">geology</hi> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4986.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">C. Lyell 1830–3</ref>) was mentioned in the concluding pages of the review: ‘We trust that he [CD] is mistaken in believing that he may count Sir C. Lyell as one of his converts … no man has been more distinct and more logical in the denial of the transmutation of species than Sir C. Lyell, and that not in the infancy of his scientific life, but in its full vigour and maturity.’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8372.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">[Wilberforce] 1860</ref>, p. 263). Several of Lyell’s remarks against transmutation were quoted.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f6">It appears that pp. 251–2 were cut out and a replacement leaf stuck onto the remaining stub, but it is not known why this was done.</note>
