            <p>Auguste Bravard’s discoveries magnificent.</p> 
<p>Bravard has sent pamphlets [<hi rend="italic">Observaciones geológicas</hi> (1857) and <hi rend="italic">Monografia de los terrenos marinos terciarios</hi> (1858)] with strange doctrine that Pampean deposit is subaerial.</p>  
<p>Review of <hi rend="italic">Origin</hi> by Wollaston [<hi rend="italic">Ann. &amp; Mag. Nat. Hist.</hi> 3d ser. 5 (1860): 132–43] clever and misinterprets CD only in a few places.</p>  
<p>Wallace’s MS ["Zoological geography of the Malay Archipelago", <hi rend="italic">J. Proc. Linn. Soc. Lond. (Zool.)</hi> 4 (1860): 172–84] admirably good.</p> 
            <p>Henslow "will go very little way with us". "He, also, shudders at the eye!"</p>
            <p>Baden Powell says CD’s statement about eye is conclusive.</p>
            <p>Leonard Jenyns cannot go as far as CD, yet cannot give good reason.</p>

<p>It is <hi rend="underline">very</hi> goodnatured in you to write &amp; tell me so many things which are very interesting to me. Bravard’s discoveries seem to me magnificent, &amp; especially interesting is the fact of Palæotherium Paranense, taken with (I think) the Nebraska Palæotherium.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> Bravard has sent me two Spanish pamphlets (which I find to my surprise I can hardly translate) in which he has strange geological doctrine, of whole enormous Pampean deposit being a <hi rend="underline">subaerial</hi> deposit.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> He disputes the coembedment of the Bahia Blanca fossils with recent shells; but I am by no means convinced. It seems to me impossible that a whole skeleton, (even to knee-cap) could be washed out of one formation &amp; embedded in another &amp; that other formation a turbulent one with largish pebbles &amp; cross layers.—</p>
<p>I am perfectly convinced (having read this morning) that the Review in Annals is by Wollaston:<ref target="#foot.f3"/> no one else in the world would have used so many parentheses. I have written to him &amp; told him that the “pestilent” fellow thanks him for his kind manner of speaking about him.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I have also told him that he w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be pleased to hear that the B. of Oxford says it is the most unphilosophical work he has ever read.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> The review seems to me clever &amp; only misinterprets me in a few places. Like all hostile men he passes over the explanation given of Classification, Morphology, Embryology &amp; Rudimentary organs &amp;c.— —</p>
<p>I read Wallace’s paper in M.S &amp; thought it admirably good: he does not know that he has been anticipated about <hi rend="underline">depth</hi> of intervening sea determining distribution.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> The expression “coincidence” in time &amp; space between new &amp; old species is unfortunate, as he believes, as we do, that new species are very <hi rend="underline">slowly</hi> formed.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/> The most curious point in Paper seems to me that about the African character of the Celebes productions;<ref target="#foot.f8"/> but I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. require further confirmation: I believe the aberrant Anoa, or so-called Antelope is really a small Buffalo.—</p>
<p>That is a <hi rend="underline">very very</hi> interesting fact of the Loess Man belonging to peculiar of man;<ref target="#foot.f9"/> do get that well worked out.— <ref target="#foot.f10"/> Remember what you told me of fossil monkey; very man-like in middle Tertiaries. I will send (when I get from Hooker) Asa Gray’s capital review.—<ref target="#foot.f11"/> Henslow is staying here:<ref target="#foot.f12"/> I have had some talk with him: he is in much same state as Bunbury<ref target="#foot.f13"/> &amp; will go a very little way with us, but brings up no real argument against going further. He, also, shudders at the Eye!<ref target="#foot.f14"/> It is really curious (&amp; perhaps is an argument in our favour) how differently different opposers view the subject.— Henslow used to rest his opposition on imperfection of Geolog: Record, but he now thinks nothing of this, &amp; says I have got well out of it; I wish<ref target="#foot.f15"/> I could quite agree with him. Baden Powell says he never read anything so conclusive as my statement about the Eye!!<ref target="#foot.f16"/> A stranger writes to me about “sexual selection” &amp; regrets that I boggle about such a trifle as the brush of Hair on Male Turkey. And so on.—</p>
<p>As L. Jenyns has a really philosophical mind, &amp; as you say you like to see everything, I send an old letter of his.<ref target="#foot.f17"/> In a later letter to Henslow which I have seen, he is more candid than any opposer I have heard of; for he says though he <hi rend="underline">cannot</hi> go as far as I do, yet he can give no good reason why he should not.— <ref target="#foot.f18"/> It is funny how each man draws his own imaginary line at which to halt.— It reminds me so vividly what I was told about you, when I first commenced geology, to believe a <hi rend="underline">little</hi> but on no account to believe all.—<ref target="#foot.f19"/></p>
<p>Ever yours affect | C. Darwin</p>
<p>I hope you will succeed in finding out what the <hi rend="underline">great</hi> Celts were used for, it bears on state of civilisation of the old natives.—<ref target="#foot.f20"/></p>
<p>Henslow means this spring to visit the Celt-Beds in France<ref target="#foot.f21"/></p>
<p>Many thanks for Bunbury letter received this morning &amp; for your note.—<ref target="#foot.f22"/> I doubt whether I use term Natural Selection more as a Person, than writers use Attraction of Gravity as governing the movement of Planets &amp;c. but I suppose I could have avoided the ambiguity.</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f19">This probably alludes to the time, just before the <hi rend="italic">Beagle</hi> sailed, when Henslow advised CD to read Lyell’s <hi rend="italic">Principles</hi> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4986.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">C.

            <note xml:id="foot.f20">This and the following paragraph were written in pencil on a separate sheet of paper and enclosed with the letter. ‘Celts’ are large, shaped flints. Lyell was investigating the possible origin of the flints as part of his study of the antiquity of man (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 7, letters to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3051.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Charles Lyell</ref>, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-2486.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">2 September [1859]</ref> and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-2492.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">20 September [1859]</ref>).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f21">Henslow was not convinced that the celts were of the same age as the fossil remains with which they were found; he reported his doubts in a series of letters printed in the <hi rend="italic">Athenæum</hi> in 1859 and 1860. In the autumn of 1860 he visited the gravel pits in Abbeville and Amiens, where various shaped flints had been found, and returned ‘impressed with the conviction, that the facts I have witnessed do not <hi rend="italic">of necessity</hi> support the hypothesis of a pre-historic antiquity for these works of man.’ (<hi rend="italic">Athenæum</hi>, 20 October 1860, p. 516).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f22">This paragraph was also written in pencil on a second slip of paper and enclosed with the letter.
