<p>I enclose a few remarks &amp; Extracts on Pigeons, for the <hi rend="underline">chance</hi> of your liking to use one or two, &amp; thus raising a smile.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> They have amused some of my friends.— If you do use them, do not mention M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Eaton’s name or other names, as he is my friend.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>I have got fine large drawings of Pouter, Carrier &amp; Tumbler; I have only small drawings in Books of Fantails, Barbs &amp; Scanderoon Runts; if you had these, you would have grand display of extremes of diversity.— Will they pay at R. Instit. for copying on large size drawings of these Birds?— I could lend skulls of Carrier &amp; Tumbler (to show great difference) for same purpose; but it would not probably be worth while.</p>
<p>I have been looking at my M.S.— What you want, I believe, is about Hybridism &amp; Breeding— The Chapt. on Hybridism is in pretty good state, about 150 folio pages with notes &amp; references on Back.— My 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>. Chapt. on Breeding is in too bad &amp; imperfect a state to send; but my discussion on Pigeons (in about 100 folio pages) is in pretty good state.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I am perfectly convinced that you would never have patience to read such volumes of MS.—</p>
<p>I speak now in palace of truth, &amp; pray do you: if you think you would read them I will send them <hi rend="underline">willingly</hi> up by my servant, or bring them myself next week. But I have no copy, <hi rend="underline">&amp; I never</hi> <hi rend="underline">could possibly replace them</hi>; &amp; without you really thought that you would use them, I had rather not risk them.— But I repeat I will <hi rend="doubleUnderline">willingly</hi> bring them, if you think you would have <hi rend="underline">vast</hi> patience to use them.— Please let me hear on this subject &amp; whether I shall send book with <hi rend="underline">small</hi> drawings of 3 other Breeds—or skulls.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I am very tired | so good night | C. Darwin</p>
<p>I have heard rumour that Busk is on our side in regard to Species: is this so?<ref target="#foot.f5"/> It would be very good.— [Enclosure] The drawings of Pigeons are by Wolstenholme (an excellent Fancier himself)<ref target="#foot.f6"/> &amp; were made for M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> J. M. Eaton, author of excellent treatise, chairman of a Club &amp; great winner of prizes.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> The drawings are not more exaggerated than the Apollo Belvidere compared with man or the Venus de Medici compared with beautiful woman.— They represent the standard of perfection.</p>
<p>To illustrate what I have somewhere said that each domestic breed delights in following its habits or instincts—you might state, that when a Pouter will not “show” ie inflate crop; the Fancier puts the bird’s beak into his mouth &amp; blows up the crop (as I have witnessed) &amp; then the bird inflated with wind &amp; pride struts about, &amp; <hi rend="underline">evidently</hi> tries to keep all the wind in, as long as it can.—<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>Your audience will not know that it is Oesophagus &amp; upper part of crop which is thus distended, you might give as instance &amp; proof, that when a bird takes a good many peas &amp; water into its crop in order to feed (by disgorging) its young, as it flies with inflated crop I have heard peas rattling as in a bladder.—</p>
<p>I have insisted what extreme attention &amp; close observation are necessary to be a good fancier; listen to the great judge &amp; writer, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Eaton</p>
<p>“I would here particularly guard you against having too great a variety of Pigeons, otherwise you will know a little of all the species (ie breeds) but nothing about one as it ought to be known. It is possible that there may be a few Fanciers that have a good <hi rend="underline">general</hi> knowledge of Fancy Pigeons. It only bothers and confuses the young Fancier if he attempts too much at once; therefore my advice to him is to make himself master of one species alone; &amp; I have no doubt his observation will teach him he has work enough in giving his whole attention to one”.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>Further on, in his Treatise devoted to the Almond Tumbler <hi rend="underline">alone</hi>, which is a sub-variety—of the short-faced variety, which is a variety of the Tumbler, as that is of the Rock-pigeon.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Eaton says “There are some of the young Fanciers who are over covetous, who go for all the five properties at once (ie the five characteristic points which are mainly attended to C.D), they have their reward by getting nothing.”.—<ref target="#foot.f10"/> In short it is almost beyond the human intellect to attend to <hi rend="doubleUnderline">all</hi> the excellencies of the Almond Tumbler!</p>
<p>To show how systematically selection is followed—again listen to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Eaton</p>
<p>“There are many of the first-rate Fanciers who are particularly partial to what is called the Gold-finch Beak (in short-faced Tumblers.) &amp; I would advise the inexperienced Fancier to get the head of a Gold-finch &amp; keep it by him for his observations”.—<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
<p>N.B. The men who attend to these short-faced Tumblers are called “Short-faced Fanciers”.</p>
<p>To be a good Breeder &amp; to succeed in improving any Breed, beyond everything enthusiasm is required. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Eaton has gained lots of prizes, listen to him (&amp; attend to the little tailor’s grammar)</p>
<p>“If it was possible for noblemen &amp; gentlemen to know the amazing amount of solace &amp; pleasure derived from the Almond Tumbler, when they begin to understand their (ie tumbler’s) properties, I should think that scarce any noble-man or gentleman would be without their aviaries of Almond Tumblers”.—<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
