            <p>Lyell’s position on mutability appears more positive in his letters to JDH than in those to CD. Considers JDH a convert.</p>

<p>I congratulate you on your Introduction being in fact finished; I am sure, from what I read of it (&amp; deeply I shall be interested in reading it straight through) that it must have cost you a prodigious amount of labour &amp; thought.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I shall like very much to see the sheet, which you wish me to look at. Now I am so completely a gentleman, that I have sometimes a little difficulty to pass the day; but it is astonishing how idle a three weeks I have passed. If it is any comfort to you, pray delude yourself by saying that you intend “sticking to humdrum science”. But I believe it, just as much as if a plant were to say that “I have been growing all my life, &amp; by Jove I will stop growing”. You cannot help yourself; you are not clever enough for that.— You could not even remain idle as I have done for 3 weeks!</p>
<p>What you say about Lyell, pleases me exceedingly: I had not at all inferred from his letters that he had come so much round. I remember thinking above a year ago; that if ever I lived to see Lyell, yourself &amp; Huxley come round, partly by my Book &amp; partly by their own reflexions, I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. feel that the subject was safe; &amp; all the world might rail, but that ultimately the theory of Natural Selection (though no doubt imperfect in its present condition, &amp; embracing many errors) would pre-vail. Nothing will ever convince me that three such men, with so much diversified knowledge, &amp; so well accustomed to search for truth, could err greatly. I have spoken of you here as a convert made by me, but I know well how much larger the share has been of your own self-thought. I am intensely curious to hear Huxley’s opinion of my Book: I fear my long discussion on classification will disgust him; for it is much opposed to what he once said to me.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>But how I am running on; you see how idle I am. But I have so enjoyed your letter, that you must forgive me.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>With respect to migration during Glacial period, I think Lyell quite comprehends, for he has given me a supporting fact.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> But perhaps he unconsciously hates (do not say so to him) the view, as slightly staggering him on his favourite theory of all changes of climate being due to changes in relative position of land &amp; water.—</p>
<p>I will send copies of my Book to all the men, specified by you; but as I do not know Pamphlin, &amp; shall send through Williams &amp; Norgate,<ref target="#foot.f6"/> would you be so kind as to add title, as Doctor or Profesor. or Monsieur or Von &amp; initials (when wanted) &amp; address to names on enclosed list,<ref target="#foot.f7"/> &amp; let me have it pretty <hi rend="underline">soon</hi>, as towards close of this week Murray says copies to go abroad will be ready.</p>
<p>I am anxious to get view generally known; &amp; not I hope &amp; think from mere personal conceit.—</p>
<p>I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. like sometime to know what special view you allude to in your Review of A. De C.—<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I fear I did not read it with any care; as I had only just read very carefully the original;<ref target="#foot.f9"/> &amp; I expected to find only an account of the work itself; I must read it again: Lyell some time ago told me it had produced a great effect on his mind.</p>
<p>I believe that your sneers at the geography of Silurian Permian periods &amp;c, are perfectly well founded.<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
<p>Farewell. I pity you for the state of your house; which I thought must have been finished long ago; farewell. The Doctor<ref target="#foot.f11"/> has brought out by wet bandages such an eruption &amp; inflammation on my legs, that I cannot move; but it has done my stomach truly wonderful good. | C. D.</p>
