<p>From<hi rend="underline"> “Von Buch on the Flora of the Canaries”</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> “On continents the individuals of one kind of plant disperse themselves very far, and by the difference of stations of nourishment &amp; of soil produce <hi rend="underline">varieties </hi> which at such a distance not being crossed by other varieties and so brought back to the primitive type, become at length permanent and distinct <hi rend="underline">species</hi>. Then if by chance in other directions they meet with an other <hi rend="underline">variety</hi> equally changed in its march, the two are become <hi rend="underline">very distinct species</hi> and are no longer susceptible of intermixture.”</p>
<p>P.S. “Natural Selection” explains <hi rend="underline">almost</hi> everything in Nature, but there is one class of phenomena I cannot bring under it,—the repetition of the forms &amp; colours of animals in distinct groups, but the two always occurring in the same country &amp; generally on the <hi rend="underline">very same spot</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> These are most striking in insects, &amp; I am constantly meeting with fresh instances. Moths resemble butterflies of the same country—<hi rend="underline">Papilios</hi> in the east resemble <hi rend="underline">Euplœ as</hi>, in America <hi rend="underline">Heliconias</hi>. At Amboyna I took on the <hi rend="underline">same tree</hi> at <hi rend="underline">the same time</hi> two <hi rend="underline">longicorns</hi> of distinct genera, but so alike in colour &amp; markings that I only separated them after some days—   Here also &amp; at Macassar occurs together a <hi rend="underline">Malacoderm</hi> &amp; an <hi rend="underline">Elater</hi> of exactly the same tints of metallic blue &amp; soft orange &amp; also similarly striate,— yet there is no affinity between them. A few days ago only I took a new &amp; curious little <hi rend="underline">Cicindela</hi> which so closely resembles in size &amp; markings a <hi rend="underline">Therates</hi> occurring with it, that I never know which it is till I take it out of my net;—yet there is no sign of a change in the structural characters which separate these <hi rend="underline">genera</hi>. It seems to shew that colour, markings &amp; texture of surface depend strictly on local conditions—   Home Entomologists might do something in experiments on breeding insects, varying conditions of food light heat &amp;c as much as they will bear. In domestic var<hi rend="superscript">s</hi>. have you discovered what tends to produce white, black, or particular coloured variations? or what tends to produce spots rather than stripes.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">The date is suggested by Wallace’s itinerary during the final years of his expedition in Malaysia. The letter clearly precedes the formulation of either Wallace’s or <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_317.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Henry Walter Bates’s</ref> views on insect mimicry and probably falls in the period between Wallace’s receiving a copy of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref> in February 1860 and the autumn of 1861, when Bates read a paper in which he explained mimicry in terms of CD’s views (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_444.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Bates 1861</ref>). Wallace had collected insects from areas around Macassar on the island of Celebes in 1856 (see Wallace 1869, 1: 334 <hi rend="italic">et seq</hi>.) and from Amboina in 1857 and 1859 (see Wallace 1869, 1: 460 <hi rend="italic">et seq</hi>.). During 1860, having left Amboina in February, Wallace visited the islands of Ceram, Goram, and Waigiou, any of which might have yielded the beetles mentioned. When he returned to Ternate in December 1860, he was ‘stupefied’ by his ‘year’s letters, accounts, papers, magazines, and books’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8126.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Wallace 1905</ref>, 1: 373). In 1861, Wallace visited Timor and its neighbouring islands, all of which were very poor in beetles (Wallace 1869, 1: 296 <hi rend="italic">et seq</hi>.).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2"><ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1020.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Buch 1825</ref>, later translated into French as <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1021.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Buch 1836</ref>. The passage Wallace translates is given in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1020.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Buch 1825</ref>, pp. 132–3, and in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1021.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Buch 1836</ref>, pp. 147–8. From the extract given here, Wallace may be responding to CD’s comments in the <ref target="./DCP-LETT-2807.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to A. R. Wallace, 18 May 1860</ref>, about people who had anticipated his theory. <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_697.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Christian Leopold von Buch</ref> was not, however, cited in the historical sketch that CD added to the third edition of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref> published in April 1861.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">In his published account of his travels in Malaysia, Wallace described how he had noticed that some species of insects, predominantly butterflies and beetles, imitated each other in their shape and colouring. It was while he was on the island of Bourn, in the Moluccas, during May and June 1861, that he first noted mimicry among birds (Wallace 1869, 2: 150–3). At the time this letter was written, Wallace evidently did not believe that the phenomenon was explicable by natural selection. Later, after considering the case of birds and the work of Bates (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_444.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Bates 1861</ref>), he came to believe that mimicry supplied powerful support for natural selection operating in nature. See Wallace 1866 and also <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8126.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Wallace 1905</ref>, 1: 401–2.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">Coloration of animals had been mentioned in previous correspondence between Wallace and CD. See <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 6, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-2086.xml" resp="#automat">letter to A. R. Wallace, 1 May 1857</ref>, and vol. 7, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-2405.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to A. R. Wallace, 25 January [1859]</ref>.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">The annotation refers to the third chapter in CD’s ‘big book’ on species, ‘On the possibility of all organic beings occasionally crossing’ (<hi rend="italic">Natural</hi> <hi rend="italic">selection</hi>, pp. 33–91).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f6">h IV‘ refers to the chapter in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref> entitled ’Natural selection‘ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref>, pp. 80–130).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f7">CD’s comment relates to his regarding the origin of the electric organs of fishes as a particular difficulty for the theory of natural selection (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref>, pp. 192–3). Not only was it hard to envisage an intermediate form of electric organ, but it was also difficult to account for the organs occurring in species widely remote in their affinities, for then the organs could not be explained as a product of inheritance from a common ancestor. In <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref>, pp. 193–4, CD suggested that the case could perhaps be explained by independent adaptations.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f8">CD cited the independently developed adaptations of some plant species to disseminate their seeds by plumes and hooks in the fourth edition of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref> (see Peckham ed. 1959, p. 357).</note>
