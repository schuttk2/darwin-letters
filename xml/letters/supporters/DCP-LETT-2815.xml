<p>I have no comment to make on your Report.—   I have forwarded it to Innes<ref target="#foot.f1"/> with your query about E. Town,<ref target="#foot.f2"/> which I cannot answer.— I have suggested to Innes that the Report ought to be sent to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Stephens<ref target="#foot.f3"/> for his approval, as he is ex officio on Committee.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Remembering that you asked M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Stephen to take the account (as well as asking me) on account of your manifold employment &amp; that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> S. refused I have asked Innes whether he had not better suggest to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Stephens to undertake this slight labour &amp; thus relieve you.—   Whether he will of course I know not.— I am pretty sure (from manner alone) that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. S. was a little sore at not being appointed to the School committee, so that some time ago I mentioned this to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Innes, &amp; he said that he had no doubt that he was ex officio on committee &amp; I informed M<hi rend="superscript"/> Stephens of this; &amp; I suspect that this soreness led him to refuse to take the accounts.—</p>
<p>Many thanks for your enquiries about Etty; her fever runs on &amp; is mild, but it is terribly wearing to her as it has now lasted 4 weeks tomorrow.—</p>
<p>Dear Lubbock | Yours very truly | C. Darwin</p>
