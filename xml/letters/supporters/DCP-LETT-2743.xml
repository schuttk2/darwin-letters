<p>Although I have nothing particular to say I must thank you for your pleasant letter of March 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> But let me say—I know what a busy man you are, &amp; pray do not waste more time over me. My book, your Review, &amp; letters &amp;c &amp;c must have consumed an awful amount. In one sense the time spent on Review has not been wasted; for I feel sure (&amp; I have again (3<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> time) read it all consecutively) that it will produce great effect, in leading people to think, &amp; that is all I wish. Hooker indeed tells me he knows cases where your article has had this effect &amp; has greatly mollified opposition to my Book.—   I agree largely to what you say about “vera causa” “theory”; “hypothesis”; indeed on reading your whole review in one read I saw that some of my remarks were rather superfluous.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>It is curious that I remember well time when the thought of the eye made me cold all over, but I have got over this stage of the complaint, &amp; now small trifling particulars of structure often make me very uncomfortable. The sight of a feather in a peacock’s tail, whenever I gaze at it, makes me sick! Under this point of view your story of the Black Pigs in the Everglades <hi rend="underline">delights</hi> me,<ref target="#foot.f4"/> &amp; supports other cases, which though founded on very good evidence I could hardly digest.—</p>
<p>Pray keep Prof. Wyman up to the mark about writing to me; I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>, also, look at it a great honour &amp; favour, <hi rend="underline">If you possibly</hi> <hi rend="underline">can find out name positively of the red nuts</hi>.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>I shall be very curious to see Agassiz’s remarks:<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I met a few days ago Prof Cooke of your Cambridge<ref target="#foot.f7"/> &amp; he brought me direct from Agassiz all sorts of very civil speeches. What can this mean? I hope to God A. is a sincere man; I had always fancied that he was so.—</p>
<p>You may like to hear about Reviews on my Book. Sedgwick (as I &amp; Lyell feel <hi rend="underline">certain</hi> from internal evidence) has reviewed me savagely &amp; unfairly in the Spectator.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> The notice includes much abuse &amp; is hardly fair in several respects. He would actually lead anyone, who was ignorant of geology, to suppose that I had invented the great gaps between successive geological formations; instead of its being an almost universally admitted dogma. But my dear old friend Sedgwick with his noble heart is old &amp; is rabid with indignation.—   It is hard to please everyone; you may remember that in my last letter I asked you to leave out about the Weald denudation:<ref target="#foot.f9"/> I told Jukes this (who is head man of Irish geological survey) &amp; he blamed me much for he believed every word of it, &amp; thought it not at all exaggerated!<ref target="#foot.f10"/> In fact geologists have no means of gauging the infinitude of past time. There has been one prodigy of a Review, namely an <hi rend="underline">opposed</hi> one by Pictet the palæontologist in the Bib. Univers. of Geneva,<ref target="#foot.f11"/> which is <hi rend="underline">perfectly</hi> fair &amp; just &amp; I agree to every word he says; our only difference being that he attaches less weight to argument in favour &amp; more to argument opposed, than I do. Of all the opposed reviews I think this the only quite fair one, &amp; I never expected to see one. Please observe that I do not class your Review by any means as opposed, though you think so yourself! it has done me <hi rend="underline">much</hi> too good service ever to appear in that rank in my eyes. But I fear I shall weary you with so much about my Book. I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> rather think there was a good chance of my becoming the most egotistical man in all Europe.! What a proud preeminence!—   Well you have helped to make me so, &amp; therefore you must forgive me if you can.—</p>
<p>My dear Gray | Ever yours most gratefully | C. Darwin</p>
