<p>I thank you for your very pleasant &amp; amusing note &amp; invitation to dinner, which I am sorry to say I cannot accept. I shall come up (stomach willing) on Thursday for Phil. Club Dinner &amp; return on Saturday, &amp; I am engaged to my Brother for Friday.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> But I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. very much like to call at the Museum on Friday or Saturday <hi rend="underline">morning</hi> &amp; see you.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Would you let me have one line either here or at 57 Queen Anne St (W.) to say at what hour you generally come to Museum &amp; whether you will be probably there on Friday or Saturday. Even if you are at Club, it will be mere chance if we sit near each other.</p>
<p>I will bring up the articles on Thursday afternoon &amp; leave them under charge of Porter at the Museum.— They will consist of larger drawing of a Pouter, a Carrier &amp; rather smaller drawings of some sub-varieties (which breed nearly true) of short-faced Tumblers. Also a small drawing of Scanderoon a kind of Runt &amp; very remarkable breed.— Also a Book with very moderately good drawing of Fan-tail &amp; Barb; but I very much doubt whether worth trouble of enlarging— Also a box (for Heaven-sake take care) with skull of Carrier &amp; short faced Tumbler: also lower jaws (largest size) of Runt middle size of Rock Pigeon &amp; the broad one of Barb. The form of ramus of jaw differs curiously in their jaws.—</p>
<p>Also M.S. of Hybridism &amp; Pigeons,—which will just weary you to death: I will call myself for or send servant for the M.S. &amp; Bones, whenever you have done with them; but do not hurry.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>You have hit on exact plan, which on advice of Lyell, Murray &amp;c I mean to follow, viz bring out separate volumes in detail &amp; I shall begin with domestic productions;<ref target="#foot.f4"/> but I am determined to try &amp; work very slowly so that, if possible, keep in somewhat better state of health. I had not thought of illustrations; that is capital advice.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>Farewell my good &amp; admirable agent for the promulgation of damnable heresies | Ever yours | C. Darwin</p>
