<p>I returned home on Friday night &amp; I saw M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Phillips on Monday.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> Enclosed is a full memorandum about the School trust money.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> You had better carefully keep this paper.— Would it not be easy to get Power of Attorney for drawing Dividends; &amp; then it would not cost you more trouble than any other Dividend. You could charge the Power to the School; or if you prefer it I would pay half the cost of the Power.—</p>
<p>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Phillips has sent me the year’s Div<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> of 10110 &amp; his own annual Subscription for 11 0.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Moreover I have now got L<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. Cranworths 550 for School &amp; 220 for Sunday School.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Shall I send you a draft for this amount.— But it would save me trouble if you would ask your Brother first to send me memorandum about the Rent which I owe Sir John, &amp; I would add it to my draft.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> Further, would you allow me to deduct 10<hi rend="superscript">s</hi> for your Subscription to Friendly Club, due last Whit Monday, &amp; which I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. much like to receive for my accounts’ sake during this year.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I would enclose a draft with a memorandum of <hi rend="underline">all</hi> these items.— Lastly about School, I enclose a Bill, sent into me for you.—</p>
<p>The latter part of my stay at Ilkley did me much good; but I suppose I never shall be strong, for the work I have had since I came back has knocked me up a little more than once. I have been busy in getting a Reprint (with a very few corrections) through the press.— My Book has been as yet <hi rend="underline">very much</hi> more successful than I ever dreamed of: Murray is now printing 3000 copies.— Have you finished it?<ref target="#foot.f7"/> if so pray tell me whether you are with me on <hi rend="underline">general</hi> issue, or against me.— If you are against me, I know well how honourable fair &amp; candid an opponent I shall have, &amp; which is a good deal more than I can say of all my opponents.— I have had grand letter from Kingsley with a capital sentence on the theological bearing of such notions as mine, &amp; which he permits me to insert in the Reprint.—<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>Pray tell me what you have been doing: have you had time for any Natural History?—</p>
<p>Dear Lubbock | Yours most sincerely | C. Darwin</p>
<p>I have got, I wish &amp; hope I might say, that <hi rend="doubleUnderline">we</hi> have got a fair number of excellent men on <hi rend="doubleUnderline">our</hi> side of question on mutability of species.—</p>
