<p>Dear Darwin</p>
<p>I have just come in from my last moonlight saunter at Oxford &amp; been sililoquizing over the Ratcliffe &amp; our old rooms at the corner &amp; cannot go to bed without inditing a few lines to you my dear old Darwin.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I came here on Thursday afternoon &amp; immediately fell into a lengthened revirie: without you &amp; my wife I was as dull as ditch water &amp; crept about the once familiar streets feeling like a fish out of water—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I swore I would not go near a Section &amp; did not for two days—but amused myself with the Colleges buildings &amp; alternate sleeps in the sleepy gardens &amp; rejoiced in my indolence. Huxley &amp; Owen had had a furious battle over Darwins absent body at Section D.,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> before my arrival,—of which more anon. H. was triumphant— You &amp; your book forthwith became the topics of the day, &amp; I d—d the days &amp; double d—d the topics too, &amp; like a craven felt bored out of my life by being woke out of my reveries to become referee on Natural Selection &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c—   On Saturday I walked with my old friend of the Erebus Capt Dayman<ref target="#foot.f4"/> to the Sections &amp; swore as usual I would not go in; but getting equally bored of doing nothing I did. A paper of a yankee donkey called Draper on “civilization according to the Darwinian hypothesis” or some such title was being read,<ref target="#foot.f5"/> &amp; it did not mend my temper; for of all the flatulent stuff and all the self sufficient stuffers—these were the greatest, it was all a pie of Herb<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> Spenser &amp; Buckle without the seasoning of either—<ref target="#foot.f6"/> however hearing that Soapy Sam<ref target="#foot.f7"/> was to answer I waited to hear the end. The meeting was so large that they had adjourned to the Library<ref target="#foot.f8"/> which was crammed with between 700 &amp; 1000 people, for all the world was there to hear Sam Oxon—   Well Sam Oxon got up &amp; spouted for half an hour with inimitable spirit uglyness &amp; emptyness &amp; unfairness, I saw he was coached up by Owen &amp; knew nothing &amp; he said not a syllable but what was in the Reviews— he ridiculed you badly &amp; Huxley savagely—   Huxley answered admirably &amp; turned the tables,<ref target="#foot.f9"/> but he could not throw his voice over so large an assembly, nor command the audience; &amp; he did not allude to <hi rend="underline">Sam’s</hi> weak points nor put the matter in a form or way that carried the audience. The battle waxed hot. Lady Brewster fainted,<ref target="#foot.f10"/> the excitement increased as others spoke—my blood boiled, I felt myself a dastard; now I saw my advantage—I swore to myself I would smite that Amalekite Sam<ref target="#foot.f11"/> hip &amp; thigh if my heart jumped out of my mouth &amp; I handed my name up to the President (Henslow) as ready to throw down the gauntlet—<ref target="#foot.f12"/> I must tell you that Henslow as president would have none speak but those who had <hi rend="underline">arguments</hi> to use, &amp; 4 persons had been burked<ref target="#foot.f13"/> by the audience &amp; President for mere declamation: it moreover became necessary for each speaker to mount the platform &amp; so there I was cocked up with Sam at my right elbow, &amp; there &amp; then I smashed him amid rounds of aplause—   I hit him in the wind at the first shot in 10 words taken from his own ugly mouth—&amp; then proceeded to demonstrate in as few more 1 that he could never have read your book &amp; 2 that he was absolutely ignorant of the rudiments of Bot. Science—   I said a few more on the subject of my own experience, &amp; conversion &amp; wound up with a very few observations on the relative position of the old &amp; new hypotheses, &amp; with some words of caution to the audience—   Sam was shut up—had not one word to say in reply &amp; the meeting <hi rend="underline">was dissolved</hi> <hi rend="underline">forthwith</hi> leaving you master of the field after 4 hours battle. Huxley who had borne all the previous brunt of the battle &amp; who never before (thank God) praised me to my face, told me it was splendid, &amp; that he did not know before what stuff I was made of— I have been congratulated &amp; thanked by the blackest coats &amp; whitest stocks in Oxford (for they hate their Bishop quite <hi rend="italic">[section illeg]</hi> love) &amp; plenty of ladies too have flattered me—but eheu &amp; alas never is<ref target="#foot.f14"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f8">Hooker refers to the library of the new Oxford University Museum, in which Section D held its meeting.

            <note xml:id="foot.f9">The precise wording of Huxley’s response to Wilberforce has never been established. In one version of the story, the bishop had asked Huxley whether he preferred to be descended from an ape on his grandfather’s or his grandmother’s side. Huxley gave his own account of the proceedings in a letter to Frederic Daniel Dyster about two months later: ‘If then, said I, the question is put to me would I rather have a miserable ape for a grandfather or a man highly endowed by nature and possessed of great means and influence and yet who employs those faculties for the mere purpose of introducing ridicule into a grave scientific discussion—I unhesitantly affirm my preference for the ape’ (Jensen 1988, p. 168).
