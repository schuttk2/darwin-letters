<p>My dear Lyell</p>
<p>I will now amuse myself by rereading your last letter, &amp; see if I have anything to answer.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>The extinction of Ammonites, even after what you tell me about the great breaks in upper challk does yet seem to me a most singular fact; considering how long &amp; how very largely they were developed during the Secondary periods, &amp; considering how high they are in Molluscous scale.—</p>
<p>I do not think I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. save you any trouble (I <hi rend="underline">have</hi> ordered my own copy) by ordering the Atlantic Monthly for <hi rend="underline">October</hi>; any Bookseller could order it or get it (for he has copies sent to him) at Trubners: I got lately from him the copy which you have of the August or 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. Article.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>I am very glad to hear about the Germans reading my Book.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> No one will be converted, who has not independently begun to doubt about Species.—   Is not Krohn a good fellow?<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I have long meant to write to him. He has been working at Cirripedes &amp; has detected 2 or 3 gigantic blunders, but in very difficult points. &amp; about which, I thank Heaven, I spoke rather doubtfully, such difficult dissection that even Huxley failed.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> It is chiefly the interpretation which I put on parts that is so wrong; &amp; not the parts which I describe. But they were gigantic blunders; &amp; why I say all this is, because Krohn, instead of crowing at all pointed out my errors with the utmost gentleness &amp; pleasantness.— I have always meant &amp; write to him &amp; thank him.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I suppose “D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Krohn, Bonn” would reach him.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>With respect to Guinea-pig, I have asked A. Gray where Von Baer makes this statement; unless Von B. has some wonderful new evidence what is the wild parent; the fact goes for little; for I agree with those who entirely deny that the Aperea of La Plata &amp; S. Brazil is the wild parent-stock.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> It seems that the Guinea-pig was domesticated when America was discovered.—</p>
<p>Did I ever tell you that the great Von Baer goes a long way with us on Species;<ref target="#foot.f9"/> he has read my Book with much attention.—</p>
<p>I would gladly keep myself the Hybrid Hare-Rabbit; but if I got them from France, what evidence should I have that those which I bought were half &amp; half.?— Bartlett is setting about it in right way, namely by crossing wild Hare &amp; Rabbit.—<ref target="#foot.f10"/> If you see him again just suggest that he sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. try several races of the Rabbit with Hare, if one fail; for there is some mystery about the whole case, as several have tried &amp; could never get the two species to pair.—</p>
<p>I cannot see yet how multiple origin of dog can be properly brought as argument for multiple origin of man. Is not your feeling a remnant of that deeply-impressed one on all our minds, that a species is an entity,—something quite distinct from variety? Is it not that the dog case injures the argument from fertility; so that one main argument that the races of man are varieties &amp; not 〈species, i.e. because they〉<ref target="#foot.f11"/> are fertile inter 〈se is〉 much weakened?—</p>
<p>I quite agree with what Hooker says that whatever variation is possible under culture is <hi rend="underline">possible</hi> under nature;— not that the same form would ever be accumulated &amp; arrived at by selection for man’s pleasure, &amp; by natural selection for the organism’s own good.—</p>
<p>Talking of “Natural Selection”, if I had to commence de novo, I would have used 〈natural preservation〉;<ref target="#foot.f12"/> for I find men like Harvey of Dublin cannot understand me; though he has read the Book twice.<ref target="#foot.f13"/> D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gray of B. Museum, remarked to me that “<hi rend="underline">Selection</hi> was obviously impossible with plants”! “No one could tell him how it could be possible”.—<ref target="#foot.f14"/> And he may now add that the Author did not attempt it to him!—</p>
<p>Yours ever affect | C. Darwin</p>
