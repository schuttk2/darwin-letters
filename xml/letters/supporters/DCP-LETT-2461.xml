            <p>JDH finds style of CD’s MS obscure.</p>
            <p>CD wary of JDH’s starting point on variability: it is not inherent, it does not lead necessarily to divergence, and it must be distinguished from inheritance.</p>
            <p>Asa Gray has misread CD’s views on pre-glacial migrations and botched the subject.</p>

<p>Thank you for telling me about obscurity of style. But on my life no nigger with lash over him could have worked harder at clearness than I have. But the very difficulty to me, by itself leads to probability that I fail. Yet one lady who has read all my M.S. has found only 2 or 3 obscure sentence.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> But M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Hooker having so found it, makes me tremble.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I will do my best in proofs. You are a good man to take trouble to write about it—</p>
<p>With respect to our mutual muddle, I never for a moment thought we could not make our ideas clear to each other by talk or if either of us had time to write in extenso.</p>
<p>I imagine from some expressions (but if you asked me what, I could not answer) that you look at variability as some necessary contingency with organisms, &amp; further that there is some necessary tendency in the variability to go on diverging in character or degree.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> <hi rend="underline">If you do</hi>, I do not agree. “Reversion” again, (a form of inheritance) I look at as no way directly connected with variation, though of course inheritance is of fundamental importance to us, for if a variation be not inherited, it is of no signification to us.— It was on such points as these I <hi rend="underline">fancied</hi> that we perhaps started differently.—</p>
<p>I fear that my Book will not deserve at all the pleasant things you say about it &amp; good Lord how I do long to have done with it:—</p>
<p>Since the above was written I have received &amp; been <hi rend="underline">much interested</hi> by A. Gray. I am delighted at his note about my &amp; Wallace’s paper:<ref target="#foot.f4"/> He will go round, for it is futile to give up very many species, &amp; stop at an arbitrary line at others. It is what my grandfather called Unitarianism, “a feather-bed to catch a falling Christian”.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>The geology at p. 447 seems to be inextricable confusion.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>Some time ago A. Gray wrote to me for my notions on recent migration during late periods, &amp; I gave him the passage <hi rend="underline">before</hi> Glacial period by the almost continuous circumpolar land.— I presume he alludes to this, not correctly, by putting me before E. Forbes Hooker &amp; De Candolle.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>But he has changed my doctrine, apparently after consulting Dana.—<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I knew there was some slight evidence from range of the shell Gnathodon in U. States of warmer climate <hi rend="underline">since</hi> Glacial epoch; but I do not believe there is any such evidence for Europe.— I once consulted Lyell on this point &amp; he seemed to know little &amp; be very doubtful about this warmer period since Glacial. I <hi rend="underline">doubt</hi> whether Megatherium &amp; Co. have really been found together with the <hi rend="underline">northern</hi> Elephant; nor do I at all admit that Megatherium, Mylodon &amp; Co are by themselves proof of warmer climate. The argument from the woolly Elephant &amp; woolly Rhinoceros I look at as false.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>If my letter did start these speculations, I am sorry I ever wrote it, for in my opinion they botch the subject.—</p>
<p>Yours affect | C. Darwin</p>
<p>I return the Paper by this Post</p>
