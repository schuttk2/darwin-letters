<p>It is a horrid shame to trouble you, busy as you always are, but there is one point on which I am very anxious to gain information &amp; possibly it may be gained in the S. of your country &amp; I can think of no one to apply to but you. Old writers often insist on differences of constitution going with complexion; &amp; I want <hi rend="underline">much</hi> to know whether there is any truth in this. It has occurred to me that liability to such a disease as yellow-fever would answer my question in the best possible way. Do you know anyone of a scientific mind to whom to apply to ask whether any observations have ever been made or <hi rend="underline">published</hi>, whether Europeans (without of course any <hi rend="underline">cross with</hi> <hi rend="underline">negro-blood</hi>) of dark complexion &amp; black hair are more liable or less liable to be attacked with yellow-fever, (or any <hi rend="underline">remittent Fever</hi>) than persons of light complexion. If you could aid me in this it would be of much value to me.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> But do not trouble yourself to write merely to acknowledge this.—</p>
<p>I have just published a little notice in Gardeners Ch. on the fertilisation of Leguminous plants, which rather bears on our Fumariaceous discussion.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I sincerely hope that you are well &amp; not working yourself to death</p>
<p>Pray believe me | My dear Gray | Yours most sincerely | C. Darwin</p>
<p>A sort of vague feeling comes over me that I have asked you all this before; if I have, I beg very many apologies.— I know I once wrote several letters to various parts of world for similar information.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
