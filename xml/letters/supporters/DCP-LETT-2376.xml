<p>I suppose that you meant me to return the enclosed to you &amp; not to Hooker.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>The letter strikes me as a very good one.</p>
<p>Since signing I have had many serious attacks of misgivings &amp; quandarums, but I am coming daily to think more &amp; more that you are all right &amp; that my fears were vain &amp; cowardly.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> There is only one thing which I cannot help regretting that as soon as you had definitely made up your minds to exact terms &amp;c of memorial that you did not pay Murchison the compliment, (for it would have been nothing more) of telling him before the memorial was sent in.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I have a great respect for Murchison, notwithstanding his palpable &amp; not unaimiable weaknesses.</p>
<p>I hope to God you will all be rewarded by a noble Museum.</p>
<p>Farewell | Yours most truly | C. Darwin</p>
<p>I have so strong a belief in the arrogance &amp; presumption of our Governors, that I cannot put much faith in a memorial even if signed by every real man of science, having much influence at least with such a poor creature as B. Disraeli.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
