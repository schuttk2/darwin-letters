<p>Thanks for HS’s <hi rend="italic">Essays: </hi> [<hi rend="italic">scientific, political, and speculative</hi>, vol. 1 (1858)]. Admires his general argument for the development theory.</p> 
            <p>CD is preparing an abstract on change of species. He treats subject as a naturalist, not from a general point of view. Otherwise he might have quoted HS’s argument to great advantage.</p>
            <p>CD particularly liked articles on music and style. Expression is a favourite topic with CD. Agrees all expression is biological.</p>

<p>I beg permission to thank you sincerely for your very kind present of your Essays.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I have already read several of them with much interest. Your remarks on the general argument of the so-called Development Theory seem to me admirable.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I am at present preparing an abstract of a larger work on the changes of species; but I treat the subject simply as a naturalist &amp; not from a general point of view; otherwise, in my opinion, your argument could not have been improved on &amp; might have been quoted by me with great advantage.</p>
<p>Your article on Music has also interested me much, for I had often thought on the subject &amp; had come to nearly the same conclusion with you, though unable to support the notion in any detail.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Furthermore by a curious coincidence Expression has been for years a favourite subject with me for <hi rend="underline">loose</hi> speculation, &amp; I most entirely agree with you that all expression has some biological meaning.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>I hope to profit by your criticisms on style,<ref target="#foot.f6"/> &amp; with my best thanks, I beg leave to remain | Dear Sir | Yours truly obliged | C. Darwin</p>
